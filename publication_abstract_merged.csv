Preprint.,Article has no keywords,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease with currently no universally highly effective prevention strategies. Identifying pathogenic immune phenotypes in 'At-Risk' populations prior to clinical disease onset is crucial to establishing effective prevention strategies. Here, we applied mass cytometry to deeply characterize the immunophenotypes in blood from At-Risk individuals identified through the presence of serum antibodies to citrullinated protein antigens (ACPA) and/or first-degree relative (FDR) status (n=52), as compared to established RA (n=67), and healthy controls (n=48). We identified significant cell expansions in At-Risk individuals compared with controls, including CCR2+CD4+ T cells, T peripheral helper (Tph) cells, type 1 T helper cells, and CXCR5+CD8+ T cells. We also found that CD15+ classical monocytes were specifically expanded in ACPA-negative FDRs, and an activated PAX5 low naïve B cell population was expanded in ACPA-positive FDRs. Further, we developed an ""RA immunophenotype score"" classification method based on the degree of enrichment of cell states relevant to established RA patients. This score significantly distinguished At-Risk individuals from controls. In all, we systematically identified activated lymphocyte phenotypes in At-Risk individuals, along with immunophenotypic differences among both ACPA+ and ACPA-FDR At-Risk subpopulations. Our classification model provides a promising approach for understanding RA pathogenesis with the goal to further improve prevention strategies and identify novel therapeutic targets."

Preprint.,Article has no keywords,"Allograft rejection is a frequent complication following solid organ transplantation, but defining specific immune subsets mediating alloimmunity has been elusive due to the scarcity of tissue in clinical biopsy specimens. Single cell techniques have emerged as valuable tools for studying mechanisms of disease in complex tissue microenvironments. Here, we developed a highly multiplexed imaging mass cytometry panel, single cell analysis pipeline, and semi-supervised immune cell clustering algorithm to study archival biopsy specimens from 79 liver transplant (LT) recipients with histopathological diagnoses of either no rejection (NR), acute T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR), or chronic rejection (CR). This approach generated a spatially resolved proteomic atlas of 461,816 cells derived from 98 pathologist-selected regions of interest relevant to clinical diagnosis of rejection. We identified 41 distinct cell populations (32 immune and 9 parenchymal cell phenotypes) that defined key elements of the alloimmune microenvironment (AME), identified significant cell-cell interactions, and established higher order cellular neighborhoods. Our analysis revealed that both regulatory (HLA-DR + Treg) and exhausted T-cell phenotypes (PD1 + CD4 + and PD1 + CD8 + T-cells), combined with variations in M2 macrophage polarization, were a unique signature of TCMR. TCMR was further characterized by alterations in cell-to-cell interactions among both exhausted immune subsets and inflammatory populations, with expansion of a CD8 enriched cellular neighborhood comprised of Treg, exhausted T-cell subsets, proliferating CD8 + T-cells, and cytotoxic T-cells. These data enabled creation of a predictive model of clinical outcomes using a subset of cell types to differentiate TCMR from NR (AUC = 0.96 ± 0.04) and TCMR from CR (AUC = 0.96 ± 0.06) with high sensitivity and specificity. Collectively, these data provide mechanistic insights into the AME in clinical LT, including a substantial role for immune exhaustion in TCMR with identification of novel targets for more focused immunotherapy in allograft rejection. Our study also offers a conceptual framework for applying spatial proteomics to study immunological diseases in archival clinical specimens."

The effective integration of multiple large-cohort studies promises biological insights into cells under different conditions that individual studies cannot provide. Here, we present scMerge2, a scalable algorithm that allows data integration of atlas-scale multi-sample multi-condition single-cell studies. We have generalized scMerge2 to enable the merging of millions of cells from single-cell studies generated by various single-cell technologies. Using a large COVID-19 data collection with over five million cells from 1000+ individuals, we demonstrate that scMerge2 enables multi-sample multi-condition scRNA-seq data integration from multiple cohorts and reveals signatures derived from cell-type expression that are more accurate in discriminating disease progression. Further, we demonstrate that scMerge2 can remove dataset variability in CyTOF, imaging mass cytometry and CITE-seq experiments, demonstrating its applicability to a broad spectrum of single-cell profiling technologies."

Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) cultured in autologous plasma can model the human immune response. Here, we describe a protocol to stimulate PBMCs for 72 h and measure cytokine secretion via AlphaLISA assays and cell surface activation marker expression via flow cytometry. Cryopreserved PBMCs are incubated for 72 h with various small molecule libraries and the supernatants are harvested to rapidly measure secretion levels of key cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma, interleukin 10) via the AlphaLISA assay. Almost simultaneously, the cells can be fixated and stained using antibodies against innate immune activation markers (CD80, CD86, HLA-DR, OX40) for analysis via flow cytometry. This multiplexed readout workflow can directly aid in the phenotypic identification and discovery of novel immunomodulators and potential vaccine adjuvant candidates.

Online ahead of print.,Keywords: Mathematical modeling; glioblastoma cells; immunotherapy.,"Glioblastoma is the most common and deadly primary brain tumour in adults. All glioblastoma patients receiving standard-of-care surgery-radiotherapy-chemotherapy (i.e., temozolomide-TMZ) recur, with an average survival time of only 15 months. New approaches to the treatment of glioblastoma, including immune checkpoint blockade and oncolytic viruses, offer the possibility of improving glioblastoma outcomes and have as such been under intense study. Unfortunately, these treatment modalities have thus far failed to achieve approval. Recently, in an attempt to bolster efficacy and improve patient outcomes, regimens combining chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors have been tested in trials. Unfortunately, these efforts have not resulted in significant increases to patient survival. To better understand the various factors impacting treatment outcomes of combined TMZ and immune checkpoint blockade, we developed a systems-level, computational model that describes the interplay between glioblastoma, immune, and stromal cells with this combination treatment. Initializing our model to spatial resection patient samples labelled using imaging mass cytometry, our model's predictions show how the localization of glioblastoma cells, influence therapeutic success. We further validated these predictions in samples of brain metastases from patients given they generally respond better to checkpoint blockade compared to primary glioblastoma. Ultimately, our model provides novel insights into the mechanisms of therapeutic success of immune checkpoint inhibitors in brain tumours and delineates strategies to translate combination immunotherapy regimens more effectively into the clinic. Significance Statement Extending survival times for glioblastoma patients remains a critical challenge. Although immunotherapies in combination with chemotherapy hold promise, clinical trials have not shown much success. Here, systems models calibrated to and validated against patient samples can improve preclinical and clinical studies by shedding light on the factors distinguishing responses/failures. By initializing our model with imaging mass cytometry visualization of patient samples, we elucidate how factors such as localization of glioblastoma cells and CD8+ T cell infiltration impact treatment outcomes."

Paradoxically, tacrolimus is nephrotoxic, causing irreversible tubulointerstitial damage. Therefore, infusion of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) 6 and 7 weeks post-transplantation was assessed to facilitate withdrawal of tacrolimus in the randomized phase II TRITON trial. Here, we performed detailed analysis of the peripheral blood immune composition using mass cytometry to assess potential effects of MSC therapy on the immune system. We developed two metal-conjugated antibody panels containing 40 antibodies each. PBMC samples from 21 MSC-treated patients and 13 controls, obtained pre-transplant and at 24 and 52 weeks post-transplantation, were analyzed. In the MSC group at 24 weeks, 17 CD4+ T cell clusters were increased of which 14 Th2-like clusters and three Th1/Th2-like clusters, as well as CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs. Additionally, five B cell clusters were increased, representing either class switched memory B cells or proliferating B cells. At 52 weeks, CCR7+CD38+ mature B cells were decreased. Finally, eight Tc1 (effector) memory cytotoxic T cell clusters were increased. Our work provides a comprehensive account of the peripheral blood immune cell composition in kidney transplant recipients after MSC therapy and tacrolimus withdrawal. These results may help improving therapeutic strategies using MSCs with the aim to reduce the use of calcineurin inhibitors. Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT02057965."

Epub 2023 Jul 6.,Keywords: Breast cancer 1; Cancer stem cells (CSCs) 2; Lymph node metastasis 5; Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) 4; Tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) 3.,"Breast cancer progression and metastasis are governed by a complex interplay within the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), involving numerous cell types. Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is a key prognostic marker associated with distant organ metastasis and reduced patient survival, but the mechanisms underlying its promotion by breast cancer stem cells (CSCs) remain unclear. Our study sought to unravel how CSCs reprogram TIME to facilitate LNM. Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing, we profiled TIME in primary cancer and corresponding metastatic lymph node samples from patients at our institution. To verify the derived data, we cultured CSCs and performed validation assays employing flow cytometry and CyTOF. Our analysis revealed distinct differences in cellular infiltration patterns between tumor and LNM samples. Importantly, RAC2 and PTTG1 double-positive CSCs, which exhibit the highest stem-like attributes, were markedly enriched in metastatic lymph nodes. These CSCs are hypothesized to foster metastasis via activation of specific metastasis-related transcription factors and signaling pathways. Additionally, our data suggest that CSCs might modulate adaptive and innate immune cell evolution, thereby further contributing to metastasis. In summary, this study illuminates a critical role of CSCs in modifying TIME to facilitate LNM. The enrichment of highly stem-like CSCs in metastatic lymph nodes offers novel therapeutic targeting opportunities and deepens our understanding of breast cancer metastasis."

Epub 2023 Jul 3.,Keywords: Metastasis; NETs; PAD4 inhibitors; Phenylboronic acid; Tumor microenvironment.,"As a new target for tumor therapy, PAD4 protein, shows excellent antitumor activity, and phenylboronic acid (PBA) could combine with sialic acid on the tumor surface to achieve dual targeting in situ and for metastatic tumors. The purpose of this study was therefore to modify PAD4 protein inhibitors with different phenylboronic acid groups in order to obtain highly-targeted PAD4 inhibitors. The activity and mechanism of these PBA-PAD4 inhibitors were studied in vitro by MTT assay, laser confocal analysis, and flow cytometry. The effects of the compounds on primary tumor and lung metastasis in mice were evaluated in vivo using a S180 sarcoma model and a 4T1 breast cancer model. In addition, cytometry mass (CyTOF) was used to analyze the immune microenvironment, and the results show that the PAD4 inhibitor 5i modified by m-PBA at the carboxyl terminal of ornithine skeleton had the best antitumor activity. In vitro evaluation of this activity revealed that 5i could not directly kill tumor cells but had a significant inhibitory effect on tumor cell metastasis. Further mechanism studies showed that 5i could be taken up by 4T1 cells in a time-dependent manner and distributed around the cell membrane but could not be taken up by normal cells. In addition, although 5i was distributed in the cytoplasm of tumor cells while in the nucleus of neutrophils, it could both decrease the histone 3 citrullination (H3cit) in the nucleus. In vivo 4T1 tumor-bearing mouse models, 5i inhibited breast cancer growth and metastasis in a concentration-dependent manner, and NET formation in tumor tissues was significantly reduced. In conclusion, PBA-PAD4 inhibitors show high targeting of tumor cells and good safety in vivo. By specifically inhibiting PAD4 protein in the neutrophil nucleus, PBA-PAD4 inhibitors also show excellent antitumor activity toward growth and metastasis in vivo, which provides a new idea for the design of highly-targeted PAD4 inhibitors."

Online ahead of print.,Article has no keywords,"Keratoacanthoma (KA) is a common keratinocyte neoplasm that is regularly classified as a type of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) despite demonstrating benign behavior. Differentiating KA from well-differentiated cSCC is difficult in many cases due to the substantial overlap of clinical and histological features. Currently, no reliable discriminating markers have been defined, and consequently, KAs are often treated similarly to cSCC, creating unnecessary surgical morbidity and healthcare costs. Here, we used RNAseq to identify key differences in transcriptomes between KA and cSCC, which suggested divergent keratinocyte populations between each tumor. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) was then used to identify single-cell tissue characteristics, including cellular phenotype, frequency, topography, functional status, and interactions between KA and well-differentiated cSCC. We found that cSCC had significantly increased proportions of Ki67+ keratinocytes among tumor keratinocytes, which were dispersed significantly throughout non-basal keratinocyte communities. In cSCC, regulatory T cells (Tregs) were more prevalent and held greater suppressive capacity. Furthermore, cSCC Tregs, tumor-associated macrophages, and fibroblasts had significant associations with Ki67+ keratinocytes as opposed to avoidances with KA, indicating a more immunosuppressive environment. Our data suggest that multicellular spatial features can serve as a foundation to enhance the histological discrimination of ambiguous KA and cSCC lesions."

Here, we established a syngeneic immunocompetent mouse model in breast cancer and demonstrated that ectopic RNase1 expression significantly inhibited tumor progression. Overall changes in immunological profiles in the mouse tumors were analyzed by mass cytometry and showed that the RNase1-expressing tumor cells significantly induced CD4+ Th1 and Th17 cells and natural killer cells and reduced granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells, supporting that RNase1 favors an antitumor TME. Specifically, RNase1 increased expression of T cell activation marker CD69 in a CD4+ T cell subset. Notably, analysis of cancer-killing potential revealed that T cell-mediated antitumor immunity was enhanced by RNase1, which further collaborated with an EGFR-CD3 bispecific antibody to protect against breast cancer cells across molecular subtypes. Our results uncover a tumor-suppressive role of RNase1 through adaptive immune response in breast cancer in vivo and in vitro, providing a potential treatment strategy of combining RNase1 with cancer immunotherapies for immunocompetent patients."

A hallmark of HD along with other psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases is alteration in the neuronal circuitry and synaptic loss. Microglia and peripheral innate immune activation have been reported in pre-symptomatic HD patients; however, what ""activation"" signifies for microglial and immune function in HD and how it impacts synaptic health remains unclear. In this study we sought to fill these gaps by capturing immune phenotypes and functional activation states of microglia and peripheral immunity in the R6/2 model of HD at pre-symptomatic, symptomatic and end stages of disease. These included characterizations of microglial phenotypes at single cell resolution, morphology, aberrant functions such as surveillance and phagocytosis and their impact on synaptic loss in vitro and ex vivo in R6/2 mouse brain tissue slices. To further understand how relevant the observed aberrant microglial behaviors are to human disease, transcriptomic analysis was performed using HD patient nuclear sequencing data and functional assessments were conducted using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia. Our results show temporal changes in brain infiltration of peripheral lymphoid and myeloid cells, increases in microglial activation markers and phagocytic functions at the pre-symptomatic stages of disease. Increases in microglial surveillance and synaptic uptake parallel significant reduction of spine density in R6/2 mice. These findings were mirrored by an upregulation of gene signatures in the endocytic and migratory pathways in disease-associated microglial subsets in human HD brains, as well as increased phagocytic and migratory functions of iPSC-derived HD microglia. These results collectively suggest that targeting key and specific microglial functions related to synaptic surveillance and pruning may be therapeutically beneficial in attenuating cognitive decline and psychiatric aspects of HD."

Online ahead of print.,Article has no keywords,"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a typically immune suppressed lymphoma subtype with poor response to immune checkpoint blockade and CAR T cell therapy. Recent data demonstrated an association between an activated, myofibroblast-like tumor stroma with improved outcome. Based on these findings, Apollonio and colleagues explored the phenotypic, transcriptional, and functional state of fibroblastic reticular cells (FRC) in human and murine DLBCL. This study reveals that DLBCL cells trigger the activation and remodeling of FRCs, leading to a chronic inflammatory state that supports malignant B cell survival. Transcriptional reprogramming of the FRCs may inhibit CD8+ T cell migration and function through changes in homing chemokines, adhesion molecules, and antigen presentation machinery, which together limit the anti-DLBCL immune response. High-dimensional imaging mass cytometry revealed heterogeneous CD8+ T Cell and FRC neighborhoods that associated with different clinical outcomes and ex vivo modeling of the microenvironment indicated an opportunity to target the FRC network for improved T cell motility, infiltration, and effector function. This research broadens our understanding of the complex interactions between the lymph node microarchitecture and anti-tumor immune surveillance, defines structural vulnerabilities in DLBCL, and thereby offers opportunities for combined therapeutic approaches."

Although technologies to generate multiplex images of the TME are advancing, the many ways in which TME imaging data can be mined to elucidate cellular interactions are only beginning to be realized. Here, we present a novel approach for multipronged computational immune synapse analysis (CISA) that reveals T-cell synaptic interactions from multiplex images. CISA enables automated discovery and quantification of immune synapse interactions based on the localization of proteins on cell membranes. We first demonstrate the ability of CISA to detect T-cell:APC (antigen presenting cell) synaptic interactions in two independent human melanoma imaging mass cytometry (IMC) tissue microarray datasets. We then generate melanoma histocytometry whole slide images and verify that CISA can detect similar interactions across data modalities. Interestingly, CISA histoctyometry analysis also reveals that T-cell:macrophage synapse formation is associated with T-cell proliferation. We next show the generality of CISA by extending it to breast cancer IMC images, finding that CISA quantifications of T-cell:B-cell synapses are predictive of improved patient survival. Our work demonstrates the biological and clinical significance of spatially resolving cell-cell synaptic interactions in the TME and provides a robust method to do so across imaging modalities and cancer types."

We conducted a phase I clinical trial (NCT03634228) to study the safety and efficacy of milademetan (an MDM2i) with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC)±venetoclax in adult patients with relapsed refractory (R/R) or newly diagnosed (ND; unfit) TP53 wild-type AML and performed comprehensive CyTOF analyses to interrogate multiple signaling pathways, the p53-MDM2 axis and the interplay between pro/anti-apoptotic molecules to identify factors that determine response and resistance to therapy. Sixteen patients (14 R/R, 2 N/D treated secondary AML) at a median age of 70 years (range, 23-80 years) were treated in this trial. Two patients (13%) achieved an overall response (complete remission with incomplete hematological recovery). Median cycles on trial were 1 (range 1-7) and at a median follow-up of 11 months, no patients remained on active therapy. Gastrointestinal toxicity was significant and dose-limiting (50% of patients ≥ grade 3). Single-cell proteomic analysis of the leukemia compartment revealed therapy-induced proteomic alterations and potential mechanisms of adaptive response to the MDM2i combination. The response was associated with immune cell abundance and induced the proteomic profiles of leukemia cells to disrupt survival pathways and significantly reduced MCL1 and YTHDF2 to potentiate leukemic cell death. The combination of milademetan, LDAC±venetoclax led to only modest responses with recognizable gastrointestinal toxicity. Treatment-induced reduction of MCL1 and YTHDF2 in an immune-rich milieu correlate with treatment response."

In this study, we performed deep immune profiling on airway and circulating immune cells to examine the effect of immunomodulation and therapeutic outcomes of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) therapy in mice with IAV-induced ALI. Methods: Animals were inoculated intranasally with H1N1 IAV, followed by intravenous administration of vehicle, or human clinical-grade, bone marrow-derived MSCs 24-h later, and monitored for six days to evaluate the survival. In another set of animals, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and whole blood were collected three days after infection for flow or mass cytometry (CyTOF) immune profiling analysis. Results: Immune cell population and phenotypic shifts in blood were mapped by CyTOF. Increases were observed in granulocytes and myeloid-derived cells in blood from vehicle-treated animals. While MSC treatment accentuated changes in these populations, naïve B, antibody-secreting B cells, and T cells were decreased in MSC-treated animals at day 3. Compared to sham animals, IAV infection induced a significant 5.5-fold increase in BAL total cell counts, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, CD11b + Ly6G + neutrophils, and CD11b + Ly6C + monocytes. MSC treatment significantly decreased BAL total cell counts in IAV-infected mice, specifically the number of infiltrating CD4+ T cells and CD11b + Ly6G + neutrophils. In contrast, there were increases in CD8+ T cells, B cells, and monocytes in the alveolar space in MSC-treated animals. Phenotypic immune cell profiling of blood and BAL revealed a significantly higher proportion of the monocyte population with the M2 phenotype (CD206) in MSC-treated animals; however, this failed to confer protective effects in the survival of infected mice or reduce viral titer in the lung. Further investigation revealed that MSCs were susceptible to IAV infection, leading to increased cell death and potentially affecting their efficacy. Conclusion: These findings provided in vivo evidence that MSCs promote the selective recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection during IAV infection, with reductions in proinflammatory phenotypes. However, MSCs offered no survival benefit in IAV-infected animals, possibly due to MSCs' H1N1 IAV susceptibility and subsequent cell death."

Therefore, it is important to deeply understand the impacts of HBV infection on HCC immune microenvironment in order to better design effective immunotherapies for HBV+ (HBV infected) HCC patients. Here, We performed cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) analyses to characterize the distinct immune compositions of HCC tumors, tumor borders, and their associations with HCC/HBV related clinical characteristics. We identified 31 distinct immune clusters and found significant associations between immune signatures with clinicopathological features of HCC. We further revealed the HBV infection had more effects on shaping immune compositions in tumor borders than in tumors, with the significant enrichment of HBV-specific PD-1+CD8+ tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells in tumor borders of HBV+ patients. We confirmed this subset with a more exhausted phenotype and respond more actively under anti-PD-L1 treatment, suggesting its involvement in immune-related liver injury induced by ICB treatment to HBV+ HCC patients. Our study shows it may be necessary to consider antiviral prophylaxis for HBV+ HCC patients receiving ICB treatment."

We compared the staining performance in FFPE tissue of antibodies for lineage-specific immune proteins (CD20, CD3, CD45, FoxP3) that were conjugated with dendrimer or linear polymer. Staining of serial tissue sections with dendron-conjugated and linear-polymer-conjugated antibodies revealed comparable avidities of dendrons and linear polymers with log2 (ratio of mean positive pixel intensity of staining for linear polymers to dendrons) within the range ±0.25. Interestingly, dendron-conjugated antibodies were observed to have some advantages over linear polymer-conjugated antibodies. For example, tissue staining of a nuclear protein, FoxP3 with dendron-conjugated antibodies showed notably less background staining than that of linear-polymer-conjugated antibodies. Additionally, dendron-conjugated antibodies did not exhibit off-target cytosolic binding in neural tissue typically observed when using linear polymer conjugates. Taken together, this work provides a versatile framework for using third-generation dendron-conjugated antibodies with improved staining over conventional linear polymers."

CCR8 is reportedly selectively expressed in tumor Tregs, and an anti-CCR8 Ab can exert potent antitumor effects by eliminating intratumor Tregs in murine tumor models. In this study, we analyzed changes to intratumor immunity after anti-CCR8 Ab administration, especially in CD8+ T cells, which are involved in cancer cell killing, using the CT26 colorectal carcinoma mouse model. Immunophenotyping of tumor-infiltrating cells by mass cytometry after Ab administration on day 5 of tumor inoculation revealed that CD8+ T cell subsets were dramatically altered in the CCR8 Ab-treated group, with an increase in naive cells and nonexhausted effector cells and a decrease in exhausted cells with high expression levels of TOX. These results were corroborated with flow cytometry analysis. Delayed administration of the anti-CCR8 Ab on day 9 or 12, when the amount of CCR8+ Tregs and CD8+ T cell exhaustion were more progressed, also resulted in a decrease in exhausted CD8+ T cells, leading to tumor regression. Finally, we confirmed that high CCR8+ Treg infiltration was associated with high TOX expression in CD8+ T cells in human cancer patients. In conclusion, administration of an anti-CCR8 Ab can dramatically alter the activation and exhaustion state of intratumor CD8+ T cells, resulting in strong antitumor effects. In cancer patients with an advanced tumor-immunosuppressive environment, CD8+ T cell exhaustion has progressed along with CCR8+ Treg induction. Therefore, targeted depletion of CCR8+ Tregs is expected to be effective in these patients."

We find tissue topological changes featured with macrophage disappearance reaction in the ulcerative colitis region, occurring only for tissue-resident macrophages. Reactive oxygen species levels are higher in the ulcerative colitis region, but reactive oxygen species scavenging enzyme SOD2 is barely detected in resident macrophages, resulting in distinct reactive oxygen species vulnerability for inflammatory macrophages and resident macrophages. Inflammatory macrophages replace resident macrophages and cause a spatial shift of TNF production during ulcerative colitis via a cytokine production network formed with T and B cells. Our study suggests components of a mechanism for the observed macrophage disappearance reaction of resident macrophages, providing mechanistic hints for macrophage disappearance reaction in other inflammation or infection situations."

This is not observed if mice were first vaccinated with spike-encoding mRNA. The protective effects of vaccination against post-acute sequelae were associated with a highly polyfunctional SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response that was recalled upon BA.1 breakthrough infection but not seen with BA.1 infection alone. Without vaccination, the chemokine receptor CXCR4 was uniquely upregulated on multiple pulmonary immune subsets in the BA.1 convalescent mice, a process previously connected to severe COVID-19.

Cell subpopulations are characterized by differences in marker expression patterns, and cells are clustered into subpopulations based on their observed expression levels. A model-based method is used to construct cell clusters within each sample by modeling subpopulations as latent features, using a finite Indian buffet process. Non-ignorable missing data due to technical artifacts in mass cytometry instruments are accounted for by defining a static missingship mechanism. In contrast with conventional cell clustering methods, which cluster observed marker expression levels separately for each sample, the FAM-based method can be applied simultaneously to multiple samples, and also identify important cell subpopulations likely to be otherwise missed. The proposed FAM-based method is applied to jointly analyse three CyTOF datasets to study natural killer (NK) cells. Because the subpopulations identified by the FAM may define novel NK cell subsets, this statistical analysis may provide useful information about the biology of NK cells and their potential role in cancer immunotherapy which may lead, in turn, to development of improved NK cell therapies."

After trauma, inflammatory cells (macrophages amongst others) are quickly recruited within the inflamed synovium and infiltrate the joint space, initiating dysregulation of cartilage tissue homeostasis. Current therapeutic strategies are ineffective, and PTOA remains an open clinical challenge. Here, the targeting potential of liposome-based nanoparticles (NPs) is evaluated in a PTOA mouse model, during the acute phase of inflammation, in both sexes. NPs are composed of biomimetic phospholipids or functionalized with macrophage membrane proteins. Intravenous administration of NPs in the acute phase of PTOA and advanced in vivo imaging techniques reveal preferential accumulation of NPs within the injured joint for up to 7 days post injury, in comparison to controls. Finally, imaging mass cytometry uncovers an extraordinary immunomodulatory effect of NPs that are capable of decreasing the amount of immune cells infiltrating the joint and conditioning their phenotype. Thus, biomimetic NPs could be a powerful theranostic tool for PTOA as their accumulation in injury sites allows their identification and they have an intrinsic immunomodulatory effect."

Complement plays a central role in post-TBI neuroinflammation, and C3 opsonins and the anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a) have been implicated in promoting secondary injury. We used single cell mass cytometry to characterize the immune cell landscape of the brain at different time points after TBI. To specifically investigate how complement shapes the post-TBI immune cell landscape, we analyzed TBI brains in the context of CR2-Crry treatment, an inhibitor of C3 activation. We analyzed 13 immune cell types, including peripheral and brain resident cells, and assessed expression of various receptors. TBI modulated the expression of phagocytic and complement receptors on both brain resident and infiltrating peripheral immune cells, and distinct functional clusters were identified within same cell populations that emerge at different phases after TBI. In particular, a CD11c+ (CR4) microglia subpopulation continued to expand over 28 days after injury, and was the only receptor to show continuous increase over time. Complement inhibition affected the abundance of brain resident immune cells in the injured hemisphere and impacted the expression of functional receptors on infiltrating cells. A role for C5a has also been indicated in models of brain injury, and we found significant upregulation of C5aR1 on many immune cell types after TBI. However, we demonstrated experimentally that while C5aR1 is involved in the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain after injury, it does not alone affect histological or behavioral outcomes. However, CR2-Crry improved post-TBI outcomes and reduced resident immune cell populations, as well as complement and phagocytic receptor expression, indicating that its neuroprotective effects are mediated upstream of C5a generation, likely via modulating C3 opsonization and complement receptor expression."

Using mass cytometry, we show alterations and differences in the emergence of NK cell populations and T cell memory differentiation between iHEU and iHUU. Specific NK cells observed at birth were also predictive of acellular pertussis and rotavirus vaccine-induced IgG and IgA responses, respectively, at 3 and 9 months of life. T cell receptor Vβ clonotypic diversity was significantly and persistently lower in iHEU preceding the expansion of T cell memory. Our findings show that HIV/ARV exposure disrupts innate and adaptive immunity from birth which may underlie relative vulnerability to infections."

Among 2D nanomaterials, transition metal carbides (MXenes) have received substantial attention for their promise as biomedical platforms. It is hypothesized that vanadium immune properties can be extended to MXene compounds. Therefore, vanadium carbide MXene (V4 C3 ) is synthetized, evaluating its biocompatibility and intrinsic immunomodulatory effects. By combining multiple experimental approaches in vitro and ex vivo on human primary immune cells, MXene effects on hemolysis, apoptosis, necrosis, activation, and cytokine production are investigated. Furthermore, V4 C3 ability is demonstrated to inhibit T cell-dendritic cell interactions, evaluating the modulation of CD40-CD40 ligand interaction, two key costimulatory molecules for immune activation. The material biocompatibility at the single-cell level on 17 human immune cell subpopulations by single-cell mass cytometry is confirmed. Finally, the molecular mechanism underlying V4 C3 immune modulation is explored, demonstrating a MXene-mediated downregulation of antigen presentation-associated genes in primary human immune cells. The findings set the basis for further V4 C3 investigation and application as a negative modulator of the immune response in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases."

Online ahead of print.,Keywords: antitumor immunity; nanocage; tumor; virus-mimicked.,"The tumor microenvironment typically possesses immunosuppressive properties that hinder the effectiveness of antitumor immune responses, even in the context of immunotherapies. However, it is observed that pathogenic microorganisms can trigger strong immune responses during infection, offering a potential means to counteract the immunosuppressive environment of tumors. In this study, a protein nanocage called CpG@HBc nanocages (NCs) is developed, which mimics the structure of the hepatitis B virus and combines with an immunostimulatory component known as cytosine phosphoguanosine oligonucleotide (CpG). By delivering these immunostimulatory agents, CpG@HBc NCs are able to effectively reverse the suppressive tumor microenvironment, resulting in the inhibition of poorly immunogenic tumors in mice. Through high-dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) analysis, remarkable alterations in immune responses is observed induced by CpG@HBc. Treatment with immunogenic CpG@HBc NCs, along with co-injection of an OX40 agonist, sensitized colorectal cancer tumors to T cell immune responses, resulting in significant impairment of tumor growth and robust immune activation. Furthermore, CpG@HBc NCs induced long-term antitumor immunological memory, protecting tumor-cured mice from tumor rechallenge. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of a virus-inspired protein nanocage to mimic anti-viral immunity and offer a unique therapeutic approach for cancer immunotherapy."

Twenty-two patients with Minnesota (MN) high-risk aGVHD received methylprednisolone 48 mg/m2/day plus 2000 units/m2 of uhCG/EGF s.c. every other day for 1 week. Patients requiring second-line aGVHD therapy received uhCG/EGF 2000 to 5000 units/m2 s.c. every other day for 2 weeks plus standard of care immunosuppression (physician's choice). Responding patients were eligible to receive maintenance doses twice weekly for 5 weeks. Immune cell subsets in peripheral blood were evaluated by mass cytometry and correlated with plasma amphiregulin (AREG) level and response to therapy. Most patients had stage 3-4 lower gastrointestinal tract GVHD (52%) and overall grade III-IV aGVHD (75%) at time of enrollment. The overall proportion of patients with a response at day 28 (primary endpoint) was 68% (57% with complete response, 11% with partial response). Nonresponders had higher baseline counts of KLRG1+ CD8 cells and T cell subsets expressing TIM-3. Plasma AREG levels remained persistently elevated in nonresponders and correlated with AREG expression on peripheral blood T cells and plasmablasts. The addition of uhCG/EGF to standard therapy is a feasible supportive care measure for patients with life-threatening aGVHD. As a commercially available, safe, and inexpensive drug, uhCG/EGF added to standard therapy may reduce morbidity and mortality from severe aGVHD and merits further study."

While female-male differences in somatosensory perception have been previously reported, no study has examined global sex differences in the abundance of DRG cell types, and the developmental origin of these differences has not been characterized. To investigate whether sex-specific differences in neuronal and glial cell types arise in the DRG during development, we performed single-cell mass cytometry analysis on sex-separated DRGs from 4 separate litter replicates of postnatal day 0 (P0) C57/BL6 mouse pups. In this analysis, we observed that females had a higher abundance of total neurons (p = 0.0266), as well as an increased abundance of TrkB+ (p = 0.031) and TrkC+ (p = 0.04) neurons for mechanoreception and proprioception, while males had a higher abundance of TrkA+ (p = 0.025) neurons for thermoreception and nociception. Pseudotime comparison of the female and male datasets indicates that male neurons are more mature and differentiated than female neurons at P0. These findings warrant further studies to determine whether these differences are maintained across development, and their impact on somatosensory perception."

However, the immunomodulatory role of fibroblasts in lymphoma remains unclear. Here, by studying human and mouse DLBCL-LNs, we identified the presence of an aberrantly remodeled fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC) network expressing elevated fibroblast-activated protein (FAP). RNA-Seq analyses revealed that exposure to DLBCL reprogrammed key immunoregulatory pathways in FRCs, including a switch from homeostatic to inflammatory chemokine expression and elevated antigen-presentation molecules. Functional assays showed that DLBCL-activated FRCs (DLBCL-FRCs) hindered optimal TIL and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell migration. Moreover, DLBCL-FRCs inhibited CD8+ TIL cytotoxicity in an antigen-specific manner. Notably, the interrogation of patient LNs with imaging mass cytometry identified distinct environments differing in their CD8+ TIL-FRC composition and spatial organization that associated with survival outcomes. We further demonstrated the potential to target inhibitory FRCs to rejuvenate interacting TILs.

Scar-associated macrophages (SAMs), a recently identified subgroup of macrophages, play an important role in this process. However, the mechanism by which SAMs transform during liver fibrosis is still unclear. In this study, we aimed to characterize SAMs and elucidate the underlying mechanism of SAM transformation. Bile duct ligation (BDL) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) were used to induce mouse liver fibrosis. Non-parenchymal cells were isolated from normal/fibrotic livers and were analyzed using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) or mass cytometry (CyTOF). The glucan-encapsulated siRNA particles (siRNA-GeRPs) was employed to perform macrophage selective gene knockdown. The results of scRNA-seq and CyTOF revealed that SAMs, which derived from bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs), accumulated in mouse fibrotic livers. Further analysis showed that SAMs highly expressed genes related to fibrosis, indicating the pro-fibrotic functions of SAMs. Moreover, plasminogen receptor Plg-RKT was highly expressed by SAMs, suggesting the role of Plg-RKT and plasminogen (PLG) in SAM transformation. In vitro, PLG-treated BMMs transformed into SAMs and expressed SAM functional genes. Knockdown of Plg-RKT blocked the effects of PLG. In vivo, selective knockdown of Plg-RKT in intrahepatic macrophages of BDL- and CCl4-treated mice reduced the number of SAMs and alleviated BDL- and CCl4-induced liver fibrosis, suggesting that Plg-RKT-PLG played an important role in liver fibrosis by mediating SAM transformation.

Across JAK2-mutant in vitro models, all four inhibitors demonstrated similar anti-proliferative phenotypes, whereas pacritinib yielded greatest potency on suppressing colony formation in primary samples, while momelotinib exhibited unique erythroid colony formation sparing. All inhibitors reduced leukemic engraftment, disease burden, and extended survival across patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, with strongest effects elicited by pacritinib. Through RNA-sequencing and gene set enrichment analyses, differential suppressive degrees of JAK-STAT and inflammatory response signatures were revealed, which we validated with signaling and cytokine suspension mass cytometry across primary samples. Lastly, we assessed the capacity of JAK2 inhibitors to modulate iron regulation, uncovering potent suppression of hepcidin and SMAD signaling by pacritinib. These comparative findings provide insight into the differential and beneficial effects of ancillary targeting beyond JAK2 and may help guide the use of specific inhibitors in personalized therapy."

Recent progress has enabled many improvements including the ability to achieve single cell spatial resolution, 3D-tissue image reconstruction, and the precise identification of different isomeric and isobaric molecules. However, MALDI-MSI of high molecular weight intact proteins in biospecimens has thus far been difficult to achieve. Conventional methods normally require in situ proteolysis and peptide mass fingerprinting, have low spatial resolution, and typically detect only the most highly abundant proteins in an untargeted manner. In addition, MSI-based multiomic and multimodal workflows are needed which can image both small molecules and intact proteins from the same tissue. Such a capability can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the vast complexity of biological systems at the organ, tissue, and cellular levels of both normal and pathological function. A recently introduced top-down spatial imaging approach known as MALDI HiPLEX-IHC (MALDI-IHC for short) provides a basis for achieving this high-information content imaging of tissues and even individual cells. Based on novel photocleavable mass-tags conjugated to antibody probes, high-plex, multimodal and multiomic MALDI-based workflows have been developed to image both small molecules and intact proteins on the same tissue sample. Dual-labeled antibody probes enable multimodal mass spectrometry and fluorescent imaging of targeted intact proteins. A similar approach using the same photocleavable mass-tags can be applied to lectin and other probes. We detail here several examples of MALDI-IHC workflows designed to enable high-plex, multiomic and multimodal imaging of tissues at a spatial resolution as low as 5 µm. This approach is compared to other existing high-plex methods such as imaging mass cytometry, MIBI-TOF, GeoMx and CODEX. Finally, future applications of MALDI-IHC are discussed."

We identify three groups of synovial CD8+CD69+CD103+ TRM cells: cytotoxic and regulatory T (Treg)-like TRM cells are present in both PsA and RA, while CD161+CCR6+ type 17-like TRM cells with a pro-inflammatory cytokine profile (IL-17A+TNFα+IFNγ+) are specifically enriched in PsA. In contrast, only one population of CD4+CD69+CD103+ TRM cells is detected and at similarly low frequencies in both diseases. Type 17-like CD8+ TRM cells have a distinct transcriptomic signature and a polyclonal, but distinct, TCR repertoire. Type 17-like cells are also enriched in CD8+CD103- T cells in PsA compared with RA. These findings illustrate differences in the immunopathology of PsA and RA, with a particular enrichment for type 17 CD8+ T cells in the PsA joint."

In most pregnancies, labor is initiated at term (≥ 37 weeks gestation), but in a signifiicant number of women spontaneous labor occurs preterm and is associated with increased perinatal mortality and morbidity. The objective of this study was to characterize the cells at the maternal-fetal interface (MFI) in term and preterm pregnancies in both the laboring and non-laboring state in Black women, who have among the highest preterm birth rates in the U.S. Using mass cytometry to obtain high-dimensional single-cell resolution, we identified 31 cell populations at the MFI, including 25 immune cell types and six non-immune cell types. Among the immune cells, maternal PD1+ CD8 T cell subsets were less abundant in term laboring compared to term non-laboring women. Among the non-immune cells, PD-L1+ maternal (stromal) and fetal (extravillous trophoblast) cells were less abundant in preterm laboring compared to term laboring women. Consistent with these observations, the expression of CD274, the gene encoding PD-L1, was significantly depressed and less responsive to fetal signaling molecules in cultured mesenchymal stromal cells from the decidua of preterm compared to term women. Overall, these results suggest that the PD1/PD-L1 pathway at the MFI may perturb the delicate balance between immune tolerance and rejection and contribute to the onset of spontaneous preterm labor."

Mass cytometry analysis of isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type human tumors identified elevated T cell checkpoint receptor expression and greater abundance of a specific CD32+CD44+HLA-DRhi macrophage population in ventricle-contacting GBM. Multiple computational analysis approaches, phospho-specific cytometry, and focal resection of GBMs validated and extended these findings. Phospho-flow quantified cytokine-induced immune cell signaling in ventricle-contacting GBM, revealing differential signaling between GBM subtypes. Subregion analysis within a given tumor supported initial findings and revealed intratumor compartmentalization of T cell memory and exhaustion phenotypes within GBM subtypes.

Defining the kinetics of age-related changes in these tissues is critical for identifying regulators of aging and evaluating interventions to slow the aging process and reduce disease risk. An altered immune microenvironment is characteristic of prostatic aging in mice, but whether features of aging in the prostate emerge predominantly in old age or earlier in adulthood has not previously been established. Using highly multiplexed immune profiling and time-course analysis, we tracked the abundance of 29 immune cell clusters in the aging mouse prostate. Early in adulthood, myeloid cells comprise the vast majority of immune cells in the 3-month-old mouse prostate. Between 6 and 12 months of age, there is a profound shift towards a T and B lymphocyte-dominant mouse prostate immune microenvironment. Comparing the prostate to other urogenital tissues, we found similar features of age-related inflammation in the mouse bladder but not the kidney. In summary, our study offers new insight into the kinetics of prostatic inflammaging and the window when interventions to slow down age-related changes may be most effective."

Given that IFNγ is secreted by cytolytic lymphocytes, which improve clinical outcomes, this role of IFNγ presents a dichotomy. To explore this conundrum, tumor NOS2, COX2, and CD8+ T cells were spatially analyzed in aggressive ER-, TNBC, and HER2 + breast tumors. High expression and clustering of NOS2-expressing tumor cells occurred at the tumor/stroma interface in the presence of stroma-restricted CD8+ T cells. High expression and clustering of COX2-expressing tumor cells extended into immune desert regions in the tumor core where CD8+ T cell penetration was limited or absent. Moreover, high NOS2-expressing tumor cells were proximal to areas with increased satellitosis, suggestive of cell clusters with a higher metastatic potential. Further in vitro experiments revealed that IFNγ + IL1β/TNFα increased the elongation and migration of treated tumor cells.

To investigate this hypothesis, we comprehensively characterized the central and peripheral immune landscape of 20-month-old male mice using cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) and investigated the role of age-associated circulating factors. We found that CD8+ T cells expressing programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) and tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells accumulated in the aged brain while levels of memory T cells rose in the periphery. Injections of plasma derived from 20-month-old mice into 5-month-old receiving mice decreased the frequency of splenic and circulating naïve T cells, increased memory CD8+ T cells, and non-classical, patrolling monocytes in the spleen, and elevated levels of regulatory T cells and non-classical monocytes in the blood. Notably, CD8+ T cells accumulated within white matter areas of plasma-treated mice, which coincided with the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), a mediator of immune cell trafficking, on the brain vasculature. Taken together, we here describe age-related immune cell changes in the mouse brain and circulation and show that age-associated systemic factors induce the expansion of CD8+ T cells in the aged brain."

Using mass cytometry, obesity favors the expansion of myeloid lineages while restricting lymphoid cells within the peripheral blood. RNA sequencing and flow cytometry revealed that obesity-associated monocytes resemble professional antigen-presenting cells due to a shift in their development and exhibit enhanced MHCII expression and CXCL2 production. Monocyte induction of the CXCL2-CXCR2 axis underlies neutrophil activation and release of neutrophil extracellular traps to promote metastasis, and enhancement of this signaling axis is observed in lung metastases from obese cancer patients. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into the relationship between obesity and cancer by broadening our understanding of the interactive role that myeloid cells play in this process."

In this study, we demonstrate the translational relevance of an ex vivo functional assay that measures the tumor cell killing ability of patient-derived CD8 T and NK cells (referred to as ""cytotoxic lymphocytes,"" or CLs) isolated from the peripheral blood of patients with renal cell carcinoma. Patient-derived PBMCs were isolated before and after nephrectomy from patients with renal cell carcinoma. We compared the efficacy of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab) and a newly developed PD-L1 inhibitor (H1A Ab) in eliciting cytotoxic function. CL activity was improved at 3 mo after radical nephrectomy compared with baseline, and it was associated with higher circulating levels of tumor-reactive effector CD8 T cells (CD11ahighCX3CR1+GZMB+). Treatment of PBMCs with FDA-approved PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors enhanced tumor cell killing activity of CLs, but a differential response was observed at the individual-patient level. H1A demonstrated superior efficacy in promoting CL activity compared with FDA-approved PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. PBMC immunophenotyping by mass cytometry revealed enrichment of effector CD8 T and NK cells in H1A-treated PBMCs and immunosuppressive regulatory T cells in atezolizumab-treated samples. Our study lays the ground for future investigation of the therapeutic value of H1A as a next-generation immune checkpoint inhibitor and the potential of measuring CTL activity in PBMCs as a tool to predict individual response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma."

We previously showed that, in Mll-AF9/NRASG12V murine AML, CD69 expression marks an LSC-enriched subpopulation with enhanced in vivo self-renewal capacity. Here, we used CyTOF to define activated signaling pathways in LSC subpopulations in Mll-AF9/NRASG12V AML. Furthermore, we compared the signaling activation states of CD69High and CD36High subsets of primary human AML. The human CD69High subset expresses low levels of Ki67 and high levels of NFκB and pMAPKAPKII. Additionally, the human CD69High AML subset also has enhanced colony-forming capacity. We applied Bayesian network modeling to compare the global signaling network within the human AML subsets. We find that distinct signaling states, distinguished by NFκB and pMAPKAPKII levels, correlate with divergent functional subsets, defined by CD69 and CD36 expression, in human AML. Targeting NFκB with proteasome inhibition diminished colony formation."

Epub 2023 May 7.,Keywords: aging; bisphosphonates; bone; senescence; senolytics.,"In addition to reducing fracture risk, zoledronic acid has been found in some studies to decrease mortality in humans and extend lifespan and healthspan in animals. Because senescent cells accumulate with aging and contribute to multiple co-morbidities, the non-skeletal actions of zoledronic acid could be due to senolytic (killing of senescent cells) or senomorphic (inhibition of the secretion of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype [SASP]) actions. To test this, we first performed in vitro senescence assays using human lung fibroblasts and DNA repair-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which demonstrated that zoledronic acid killed senescent cells with minimal effects on non-senescent cells. Next, in aged mice treated with zoledronic acid or vehicle for 8 weeks, zoledronic acid significantly reduced circulating SASP factors, including CCL7, IL-1β, TNFRSF1A, and TGFβ1 and improved grip strength. Analysis of publicly available RNAseq data from CD115+ (CSF1R/c-fms+) pre-osteoclastic cells isolated from mice treated with zoledronic acid demonstrated a significant downregulation of senescence/SASP genes (SenMayo). To establish that these cells are potential senolytic/senomorphic targets of zoledronic acid, we used single cell proteomic analysis (cytometry by time of flight [CyTOF]) and demonstrated that zoledronic acid significantly reduced the number of pre-osteoclastic (CD115+/CD3e-/Ly6G-/CD45R-) cells and decreased protein levels of p16, p21, and SASP markers in these cells without affecting other immune cell populations. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that zoledronic acid has senolytic effects in vitro and modulates senescence/SASP biomarkers in vivo. These data point to the need for additional studies testing zoledronic acid and/or other bisphosphonate derivatives for senotherapeutic efficacy."

As a graph-based clustering method, CosTaL transforms the cells with high-dimensional features into a weighted k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) graph. The cells are represented by the vertices of the graph, while an edge between two vertices in the graph represents the close relatedness between the two cells. Specifically, CosTaL builds an exact kNN graph using cosine similarity and uses the Tanimoto coefficient as the refining strategy to re-weight the edges in order to improve the effectiveness of clustering. We demonstrate that CosTaL generally achieves equivalent or higher effectiveness scores on seven benchmark cytometry datasets and six single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets using six different evaluation metrics, compared with other state-of-the-art graph-based clustering methods, including PhenoGraph, Scanpy and PARC. As indicated by the combined evaluation metrics, Costal has high efficiency with small datasets and acceptable scalability for large datasets, which is beneficial for large-scale analysis."

Here, we developed a strategy to explore the associations between exogenous metals in spermatozoa at single-cell resolution and human semen quality among 84 men screened as sperm donors, who provided 266 semen samples within 90 days. A cellular atlas of exogenous metals at the single-cell level was created with mass cytometry (CyTOF) technology, which concurrently displayed 18 metals in more than 50 000 single sperm. Exogenous metals in spermatozoa at single-cell resolution were extremely heterogeneous and diverse. Further analysis using multivariable linear regression and linear mixed-effects models revealed that the heterogeneity and prevalence of the exogenous metals at single-cell resolution were associated with semen quality. The heterogeneity of lead (Pb), tin (Sn), yttrium (Y), and zirconium (Zr) was negatively associated with sperm concentration and count, while their prevalence showed positive associations. These findings revealed that the heterogeneous properties of exogenous metals in spermatozoa were associated with human semen quality, highlighting the importance of assessing exogenous metals in spermatozoa at single-cell resolution to evaluate male reproductive health risk precisely."

Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) has significantly improved outcomes in some patients, however 80-85% of patients receiving immunotherapy develop primary resistance, manifesting as a lack of response to therapy. Of those that do have an initial response, disease progression may occur due to acquired resistance. The make-up of the tumour microenvironment (TME) and the interaction between tumour infiltrating immune cells and cancer cells can have a large impact on the response to immunotherapy. Robust assessment of the TME with accurate and reproducible methods is vital to understanding mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance.

The composition of TLS across different organs and diseases could be of pathophysiological and medical interest. In this work, we compared TLS to SLO in cancers of the digestive tract and in inflammatory bowel diseases. Colorectal and gastric tissues with different inflammatory diseases and cancers from the department of pathology of CHU Brest were analyzed based on 39 markers using imaging mass cytometry (IMC). Unsupervised and supervised clustering analyses of IMC images were used to compare SLO and TLS. Unsupervised analyses tended to group TLS per patient but not per disease. Supervised analyses of IMC images revealed that LN had a more organized structure than TLS and non-encapsulated SLO Peyer's patches. TLS followed a maturation spectrum with close correlations between germinal center (GC) markers' evolution. The correlations between organizational and functional markers made relevant the previously proposed TLS division into three stages: lymphoid-aggregates (LA) (CD20+CD21-CD23-) had neither organization nor GC functionality, non-GC TLS (CD20+CD21+CD23-) were organized but lacked GC's functionality and GC-like TLS (CD20+CD21+CD23+) had GC's organization and functionality. This architectural and functional maturation grading of TLS pointed to differences across diseases. TLS architectural and functional maturation grading is accessible with few markers allowing future diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive studies on the value of TLS grading, quantification and location within pathological tissues in cancers and inflammatory diseases."

However, this method is only capable of examining several dozens of proteins simultaneously and requires a prior knowledge of the markers to be analyzed. Here we propose that the integration of mass cytometry with shot-gun proteomics may serve as a valuable tool to achieve an in-depth understanding of the immune system. By implementing such a strategy, we investigated the immune landscape of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), a chronic inflammatory arthritis with unclear etiology. The proteome alteration in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was investigated by quantitative proteomics, and then mass cytometry analysis was conducted to decipher the immunome by considering the signaling molecules identified with differential expression by proteomics. As a result, we identified a wide spectrum of proteins dysregulated in AS, e.g., upregulation of glycolytic enzymes, downregulation of lipid transporters, and dysregulation of chemokine signaling molecules involved in proinflammatory cytokine production and leucocyte migration. Moreover, the single-cell analysis showed the upregulation of chemokine signaling regulators in subclusters of both innate and adaptive immune cells in AS. In addition, correlation analysis unveiled the interplay among Phenograph-identified subclusters of monocytes, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that the integration of mass spectrometry-based proteomics and single-cell mass cytometry may serve as a useful tool to reveal clinically relevant information regarding useful targets and cellular phenotypes that could be further exploited to develop novel therapeutic strategies."

LA platforms aim to address the lack of adherence to oral regimens, which has impaired PrEP efficacy. Despite extensive investigations in this field, tissue response to sustained subcutaneous TAF delivery remains to be elucidated as contrasting preclinical results have been reported in the literature. To this end, here we studied the local foreign body response (FBR) to sustained subdermal delivery of three forms of TAF, namely TAF free base (TAFfb), TAF fumarate salt (TAFfs), and TAFfb with urocanic acid (TAF-UA). Sustained constant drug release was achieved via titanium-silicon carbide nanofluidic implants previously shown to be bioinert. The analysis was conducted in both Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and rhesus macaques over 1.5 and 3 months, respectively. While visual observation did not reveal abnormal adverse tissue reaction at the implantation site, histopathology and Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) analyses exposed a local chronic inflammatory response to TAF. In rats, UA mitigated foreign body response to TAF in a concentration-dependent manner. This was not observed in macaques where TAFfb was better tolerated than TAFfs and TAF-UA. Notably, the level of FBR was tightly correlated with local TAF tissue concentration. Further, regardless of the degree of FBR, the fibrotic capsule (FC) surrounding the implants did not interfere with drug diffusion and systemic delivery, as evidenced by TAF PK results and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)."

Using mass cytometry (CyTOF), we observed that the TME in sMZL is distinct from that of control non-malignant reactive spleen (rSP). We found that the number of TFH cells varied greatly in sMZL, ICOS+ TFH cells were more abundant in sMZL than rSP, and TFH cells positively correlated with increased numbers of memory B cells. Treg cell analysis revealed that TIGIT+ Treg cells are enriched in sMZL and correlate with suppression of TH17 and TH22 cells. Intratumoral CD8+ T cells were comprised of subsets of short-lived, exhausted and late-stage differentiated cells, thereby functionally impaired. We observed that T-cell exhaustion was present in sMZL and TIM-3 expression on PD-1low cells identified cells with severe immune dysfunction.

This study aimed to explore the role of cellular immunity in protection against human ETEC infection. Nine volunteers were experimentally infected with ETEC, of which six developed diarrhea. Lymphocytes were collected from peripheral blood buffy coats, before and 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 28 days after dose ingestion, and 34 phenotypic and functional markers were examined by mass cytometry. Thirty-three cell populations, derived by manually merging 139 cell clusters from the X-shift unsupervised clustering algorithm, were analyzed. Initially, the diarrhea group responded with increased CD56dim CD16+ natural killer cells, dendritic cells tended to rise, and mucosal-associated invariant T cells decreased. On day 5-7, an increase in plasmablasts was paralleled by a consistent rise in CD4+ Th17-like effector memory and regulatory cell subsets. CD4+ Th17-like central memory cells peaked on day 10. All Th17-like cell populations showed increased expression of activation, gut-homing, and proliferation markers. Interestingly, in the nondiarrhea group, these same CD4+ Th17-like cell populations expanded earlier, normalizing around day 7. Earlier development of these CD4+ Th17-like cell populations in the nondiarrhea group may suggest a recall response and a potential role in controlling ETEC infections."

Bearing in mind the robustness of this technique and the high spatial context of the data it gives, it is especially valuable in studying the biology of cancer and tumor microenvironment. IMC-derived data are not classical micrographic images, and due to the characteristics of the data obtained using IMC, the image analysis approach, in this case, can diverge to a certain degree from the classical image analysis pipelines. As the number of publications based on the IMC is on the rise, this trend is also followed by an increase in the number of available methodologies designated solely to IMC-derived data analysis. This review has for an aim to give a systematic synopsis of all the available classical image analysis tools and pipelines useful to be employed for IMC data analysis and give an overview of tools intentionally developed solely for this purpose, easing the choice to researchers of selecting the most suitable methodologies for a specific type of analysis desired."

The ecological and evolutionary dynamics responsible for treatment failure are incompletely understood. Here, we performed a comprehensive multi-omic analysis of samples collected from EAC patients in the MEMORI clinical trial, revealing major changes in gene expression profiles and immune microenvironment composition that did not appear to be driven by changes in clonal composition. Multi-region multi-timepoint whole exome (300x depth) and paired transcriptome sequencing was performed on 27 patients pre-, during and after neoadjuvant treatment. EAC showed major transcriptomic changes during treatment with upregulation of immune and stromal pathways and oncogenic pathways such as KRAS, Hedgehog and WNT. However, genetic data revealed that clonal sweeps were rare, suggesting that gene expression changes were not clonally driven. Additional longitudinal image mass cytometry was performed in a subset of 15 patients and T-cell receptor sequencing in 10 patients, revealing remodelling of the T-cell compartment during treatment and other shifts in microenvironment composition. The presence of immune escape mechanisms and a lack of clonal T-cell expansions were linked to poor clinical treatment response. This study identifies profound transcriptional changes during treatment with limited evidence that clonal replacement is the cause, suggesting phenotypic plasticity and immune dynamics as mechanisms for therapy resistance with pharmacological relevance."

A total of 51 subjects (active TB [n = 34] and LTBI [n = 17]) were included. CyTOF analysis of 16 subjects (active TB [n = 8] and LTBI [n = 8]) identified a significantly higher Th17-like cell population in active TB than in LTBI. This finding was validated in the remaining 35 subjects (active TB [n = 26] and LTBI [n = 9]) using flow cytometry analysis, which consistently reveals a higher percentage of Th17 cell population in active TB (p = 0.032). The Th1/Th17 ratio represented good ability to discriminate between active TB and LTBI (AUC = 0.812). Among patients with active TB, the Th17 cell percentage was found to be lower in more advanced forms of the disease. Additionally, Th17 cell percentage positively correlated with the levels of IL-6 and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, respectively. In conclusion, CyTOF analysis of PBMCs showed a significantly higher percentage of Th17 cells in active TB although fairly similar immune cell populations between active TB and LTBI were observed."

In glioblastoma-bearing mice, α-PD-1 treatment applied at the peak of T cell infiltration post-radiotherapy results in a modest survival benefit compared with concurrent α-PD-1 administration. Following α-PD-1 therapy, CD103+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) with upregulated lipid metabolism accumulate in the tumor microenvironment, and restrain immune checkpoint blockade response by repressing CD8+ T cell activation. Treg targeting elicits tertiary lymphoid structure formation, enhances CD4+ and CD8+ T cell frequency and function and unleashes radio-immunotherapeutic efficacy. These results support the rational design of therapeutic regimens limiting the induction of immunosuppressive feedback pathways in the context of T cell immunotherapy in glioblastoma."

However, as PLWH are living longer, they are developing aging-related diseases prematurely and are more susceptible to comorbidities that have been linked to chronic inflammation. Coincident with HIV infection and aging, drug abuse has also been independently associated with gut dysbiosis, microbial translocation, and inflammation. Here, we hypothesized that injection drug use (IDU) would exacerbate HIV-induced immune activation and inflammation, thereby intensifying immune dysfunction. We recruited 50 individuals not using injection drugs (36/50 HIV+) and 47 people who inject drugs (PWID, 12/47 HIV+). All but three of the HIV+ subjects were on ART. Plasma immune profiles were characterized by immunoproteomics, and cellular immunophenotypes were assessed using mass cytometry. The immune profiles of HIV+/PWID-, HIV-/PWID+, and HIV+/PWID+ were each significantly different from controls; however, few differences between these groups were detected, and only three inflammatory mediators and two immune cell populations demonstrated a combinatorial effect of IDU and HIV infection. In conclusion, a comprehensive analysis of inflammatory mediators and cell immunophenotypes revealed remarkably similar patterns of immune dysfunction in HIV-infected individuals and in PWID with and without HIV-1 infection."

The heterogeneity of pathomechanisms that lead to SLE contributes to between-patient variation in clinical phenotype and treatment response. Ongoing efforts to dissect cellular and molecular heterogeneity in SLE could facilitate the future development of stratified treatment recommendations and precision medicine, which is a considerable challenge for SLE. In particular, some genes involved in the clinical heterogeneity of SLE and some phenotype-related loci (STAT4, IRF5, PDGF genes, HAS2, ITGAM and SLC5A11) have an association with clinical features of the disease. An important part is also played by epigenetic varation (in DNA methylation, histone modifications and microRNAs) that influences gene expression and affects cell function without modifying the genome sequence. Immune profiling can help to identify an individual's specific response to a therapy and can potentially predict outcomes, using techniques such as flow cytometry, mass cytometry, transcriptomics, microarray analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing. Furthermore, the identification of novel serum and urinary biomarkers would enable the stratification of patients according to predictions of long-term outcomes and assessments of potential response to therapy."

Here we present InterSTELLAR, a geometric deep learning framework for multiplexed imaging data, to directly link tissue subtypes with corresponding cell communities that have clinical relevance. Using a publicly available breast cancer imaging mass cytometry dataset, InterSTELLAR allows simultaneous tissue type prediction and interested community detection, with improved performance over conventional methods. Downstream analyses demonstrate InterSTELLAR is able to capture specific pathological features from different clinical cancer subtypes.

RNA sequencing reveals that CCR10+ Tregs exhibit gene expression changes consistent with enhanced immunosuppressive function. In addition, CITE-Seq demonstrates that PD-1+CD57-CD8+ memory T cells exhibit features of T-cell exhaustion. Taken together, these results provide novel evidence for decreases in anti-inflammatory and/or hypofunctional T-cell populations that may contribute to enhanced inflammation in human hypertension."

Surgery and chemoradiation are the standard of care in early stages of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), while immunotherapy is the standard of care in late-stage NSCLC. The immune composition of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is recognized as an indicator for responsiveness to immunotherapy, although much remains unknown about its role in responsiveness to surgery or chemoradiation. In this pilot study, we characterized the NSCLC TME using mass cytometry (CyTOF) and bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) with deconvolution of RNA-Seq being performed by Kassandra, a recently published deconvolution tool. Stratification of patients based on the intratumoral abundance of B cells identified that the B-cell rich patient group had increased expression of CXCL13 and greater abundance of PD1+ CD8 T cells. The presence of B cells and PD1+ CD8 T cells correlated positively with the presence of intratumoral tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS). We then assessed the predictive and prognostic utility of these cell types and TLS within publicly available stage 3 and 4 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) RNA-Seq datasets. As previously described by others, pre-treatment expression of intratumoral 12-chemokine TLS gene signature is associated with progression free survival (PFS) in patients who receive treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Notably and unexpectedly pre-treatment percentages of intratumoral B cells are associated with PFS in patients who receive surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. Further studies to confirm these findings would allow for more effective patient selection for both ICI and non-ICI treatments."

We define a differentiation axis in all tumor progression states from normal to cancer. Our data show that colorectal cancer driver mutations shape the distribution of cells along the differentiation axis. In this regard, subsequent mutations can have stem cell promoting or restricting effects. Individual nodes of the cancer cell signaling network remain coupled to the differentiation state, regardless of the presence of driver mutations.

However, the definite role of 3-HAA in the immunomodulation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is largely unexplored. An orthotopic HCC model and treated with 3-HAA by intraperitoneal injection is developed. Furthermore, cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses are carried out to define the immune landscape of HCC. It is found that 3-HAA treatment can significantly suppress tumor growth in the HCC model and alter the level of various cytokines in plasma. CyTOF data shows that 3-HAA significantly increases the percentage of F4/80hi CX3CR1lo Ki67lo MHCIIhi macrophages and decreases the percentage of F4/80lo CD64+ PD-L1lo macrophages. scRNA-seq analyses demonstrate that 3-HAA treatment is proved to regulate the function of M1 macrophages, M2 macrophages, and proliferating macrophages. Notably, 3-HAA inhibits the proinflammatory factors TNF and IL-6 in multiple cell subsets, including resident macrophages, proliferating macrophages, and pDCs. This study reveals the landscape of immune cell subsets in HCC in response to 3-HAA, indicating that 3-HAA may be a promising therapeutic target for HCC."

However, as the excessive accumulation of immune cells promotes inflammation and delays tissue repair, it is essential to identify the mechanism that limits the infiltration of immune cells to the mucosal-luminal interface. Cholesterol sulfate (CS) is the lipid product of the sulfotransferase SULT2B1 and suppresses immune reactions by inhibiting DOCK2-mediated Rac activation. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the physiological role of CS in the intestinal tract. We found that, in the small intestine and colon, CS is predominantly produced in the epithelial cells close to the lumen. While dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis was exacerbated in Sult2b1-deficient mice with increased prevalence of neutrophils, the elimination of either neutrophils or intestinal bacteria in Sult2b1-deficient mice attenuated disease development. Similar results were obtained when the Dock2 was genetically deleted in Sult2b1-deficient mice. In addition, we also show that indomethacin-induced ulcer formation in the small intestine was exacerbated in Sult2b1-deficient mice and was ameliorated by CS administration. Thus, our results uncover that CS acts on inflammatory neutrophils, and prevents excessive gut inflammation by inhibiting the Rac activator DOCK2. The administration of CS may be a novel therapeutic strategy for inflammatory bowel disease and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced ulcers."

Dimension reduction (DR) is one of the critical steps of single cell data analysis. Here, we benchmark the performances of 21 DR methods on 110 real and 425 synthetic CyTOF samples. We find that less well-known methods like SAUCIE, SQuaD-MDS, and scvis are the overall best performers. In particular, SAUCIE and scvis are well balanced, SQuaD-MDS excels at structure preservation, whereas UMAP has great downstream analysis performance. We also find that t-SNE (along with SQuad-MDS/t-SNE Hybrid) possesses the best local structure preservation. Nevertheless, there is a high level of complementarity between these tools, so the choice of method should depend on the underlying data structure and the analytical needs."

Bulk genomic landscape analysis and transcriptomic profiling have contributed to a better understanding of the recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities and immunologic cues associated with the onset of hematopoietic destruction. However, the functional mechanistic determinants underlying the complexity of heterogeneous T lymphocyte populations as well as their correlation with clinical outcomes remain to be elucidated. To uncover dysfunctional mechanisms acting within the heterogeneous marrow-infiltrating immune environment and examine their pathogenic interplay with the hematopoietic stem/progenitor pool, we exploited single-cell mass cytometry for BM mononuclear cells of severe AA (SAA) patients pre- and post-immunosuppressive therapy, in contrast to those of healthy donors. Alignment of BM cellular composition with hematopoietic developmental trajectories revealed potential functional roles for non-canonically activated CD4+ naïve T cells in newly-diagnosed pediatric cases of SAA. Furthermore, single-cell transcriptomic profiling highlighted a population of Th17-polarized CD4+CAMK4+ naïve T cells showing activation of the IL-6/JAK3/STAT3 pathway, while gene signature dissection indicated a predisposition to proinflammatory pathogenesis. Retrospective validation from our SAA cohort of 231 patients revealed high plasma levels of IL-6 as an independent risk factor of delayed hematopoietic response to antithymocyte globulin-based immunosuppressive therapy. Thus, IL-6 warrants further investigation as a putative therapeutic target in SAA."

Activation of iNKT cells with α-galactosylceramide (αGC) markedly increased immune cell infiltration and suppressed PCLM progression. Via single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) we profiled over 30,000 immune cells from normal liver and PCLM with or without αGC treatment and were able to characterize the global changes of the immune cells in the tumor microenvironment upon αGC treatment, identifying a total of 12 subpopulations. Upon treatment with αGC, scRNA-Seq and flow cytometry analyses revealed increased cytotoxic activity of iNKT/NK cells and skewing CD4 T cells towards a cytotoxic Th1 profile and CD8 T cells towards a cytotoxic profile, characterized by higher proliferation and reduced exhaustion marker PD1 expression. Moreover, αGC treatment excluded tumor associated macrophages. Lastly, imaging mass cytometry analysis uncovered the reduced epithelial to mesenchymal transition related markers and increased active CD4 and CD8 T cells in PCLM with αGC treatment.

Here, we show that the peptide-major histocompatibility complex class II (pMHCII) monospecific immunoregulatory T-cell pools that arise in vivo in different genetic backgrounds in response to pMHCII-coated nanoparticles (pMHCII-NPs) are invariably comprised of oligoclonal subpools of T follicular helper (TFH) and TR1 cells with a nearly identical clonotypic composition but different functional properties and transcription factor expression profiles. Pseudotime analyses of scRNAseq data and multidimensional mass cytometry revealed progressive downregulation and upregulation of TFH and TR1 markers, respectively. Furthermore, pMHCII-NPs trigger cognate TR1 cell formation in TFH cell-transfused immunodeficient hosts, and T-cell-specific deletion of Bcl6 or Irf4 blunts both the TFH expansion and TR1 formation induced by pMHCII-NPs. In contrast, deletion of Prdm1 selectively abrogates the TFH-to-TR1 conversion. Bcl6 and Prdm1 are also necessary for anti-CD3 mAb-induced TR1 formation.

Online ahead of print.,Keywords: CyTOF®; antibody bound per cell (ABC); expression level; high-dimensional data analysis; mass cytometry; multiplex; quantitative analysis.,"Characterization of target abundance on cells has broad translational applications. Among the approaches for assessing membrane target expression is quantification of the number of target-specific antibody (Ab) bound per cell (ABC). ABC determination on relevant cell subsets in complex and limited biological samples necessitates multidimensional immunophenotyping, for which the high-order multiparameter capabilities of mass cytometry provide considerable advantages. In the present study, we describe the implementation of CyTOF® for the concomitant quantification of membrane markers on diverse types of immune cells in human whole blood. Specifically, our protocol relies on establishing Bmax of Ab saturable binding on cells, then converted into ABC according to a metal's transmission efficiency and number of metal atoms per Ab. Using this method, we calculated ABC values for CD4 and CD8 within the expected range for circulating T cells and in concordance with the ABC obtained in the same samples by flow cytometry. Furthermore, we successfully conducted multiplex measurements of the ABC for CD28, CD16, CD32a, and CD64, on >15 immune cell subsets in human whole blood samples. We developed a high-dimensional data analysis workflow enabling semi-automated Bmax calculation in all examined cell subsets to facilitate ABC reporting across populations. In addition, we investigated impacts of the type of metal isotope and acquisition batch effect on the ABC evaluation with CyTOF®. In summary, our findings demonstrate mass cytometry is a valuable tool for concurrent quantitative analysis of multiple targets in specific and rare cell types, thus increasing the numbers of biomeasures obtained from a single sample."

To explore the underlying immune regulators, we examine the microenvironment in glioma and find that tumor-infiltrating T cells are mainly confined to the perivascular cuffs and express high levels of CCR5, CXCR3, and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). Combined analysis of T cell clustering with T cell receptor (TCR) clone expansion shows that potential tumor-killing T cells are mainly categorized into pre-exhausted/exhausted and effector CD8+ T subsets, as well as cytotoxic CD4+ T subsets. Notably, a distinct subpopulation of CD4+ T cells exhibits innate-like features with preferential interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression. With IL-8-humanized mouse strain, we demonstrate that IL-8-producing CD4+ T, myeloid, and tumor cells orchestrate myeloid-derived suppressor cell infiltration and angiogenesis, which results in enhanced tumor growth but reduced ICB efficacy. Antibody-mediated IL-8 blockade or the inhibition of its receptor, CXCR1/2, unleashes anti-PD-1-mediated antitumor immunity. Our findings thus highlight IL-8 as a combinational immunotherapy target for glioma."

While D is characterized by early activation of innate immune responses, in SDp there is rapid expansion and activation of IgG-secreting plasma cells and memory and regulatory T cells. Concurrently, SDp, particularly children, demonstrate increased proinflammatory NK cells, inadequate expansion of CD16+ monocytes, and high expression of the FcγR CD64 on myeloid cells, yet a signature of diminished antigen presentation.

However, this modality has unique data processing requirements, particularly for patient tissue specimens where signal-to-noise ratios for markers can be low, despite optimization, and pixel intensity artifacts can deteriorate image quality and downstream analysis. Here we demonstrate an automated content-aware pipeline, IMC-Denoise, to restore IMC images deploying a differential intensity map-based restoration (DIMR) algorithm for removing hot pixels and a self-supervised deep learning algorithm for shot noise image filtering (DeepSNiF). IMC-Denoise outperforms existing methods for adaptive hot pixel and background noise removal, with significant image quality improvement in modeled data and datasets from multiple pathologies. This includes in technically challenging human bone marrow; we achieve noise level reduction of 87% for a 5.6-fold higher contrast-to-noise ratio, and more accurate background noise removal with approximately 2 × improved F1 score. Our approach enhances manual gating and automated phenotyping with cell-scale downstream analyses. Verified by manual annotations, spatial and density analysis for targeted cell groups reveal subtle but significant differences of cell populations in diseased bone marrow.

Seven patients received 20-40 million allogeneic MSCs (cohort 1), while 6 patients received 40-80 million MSCs (cohort 2). Adverse events (AEs) were assessed at baseline and on weeks 2, 6, 12, and 24. Clinical, endoscopic, and biochemical parameters were assessed at baseline and on weeks 2 and 6. Furthermore, we evaluated the engraftment of MSCs, the presence of donor-specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies (DSAs), and we determined the impact of MSC therapy on the local immune compartment.RESULTSNo serious AEs were observed. The clinical Mayo score was significantly improved on weeks 2 and 6, and the EMS was significantly improved on week 6, compared with baseline. On week 6, donor MSCs were still detectable in rectal biopsies from 4 of 9 patients and DSAs against both HLA class I and class II were found. Mass cytometry showed a reduction in activated CD8+ T cells and CD16+ monocytes and an enrichment in mononuclear phagocytes and natural killer cells in biopsies after local MSC therapy.CONCLUSIONLocal administration of allogeneic MSCs is safe, tolerable, and feasible for treatment of refractory UP and shows encouraging signs of clinical efficacy and modulation of local immune responses.

Recently, the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody pembrolizumab has been recommended as a treatment option for high tumor mutational burden (TMB) solid tumors based on the data from a basket trial. However, no pancreatic cancer patients were enrolled in that trial. Whether pancreatic cancer patients with high TMB respond to PD-1 blockade as well remains unclear. Here, we report a case with a partial response to single-agent immunotherapy with pembrolizumab in pancreatic cancer with high TMB after the failure of several lines of chemotherapy. This result indicates that single-agent immunotherapy may be effective in pancreatic cancer patients with high TMB. In addition, in order to understand the basic immune state of our patients, we also analyzed the changes in immune cells in peripheral blood with cytometry by time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CyTOF) before and after pembrolizumab treatment."

We examined CD8+ T cells in human head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, regional LNs, and blood using mass cytometry, single-cell genomics, and multiplexed ion beam imaging. We identified progenitor exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tpex) that were abundant in uninvolved LN and clonally related to terminally exhausted cells in the tumor. After anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, Tpex in uninvolved LNs reduced in frequency but localized near dendritic cells and proliferating intermediate-exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tex-int), consistent with activation and differentiation. LN responses coincided with increased circulating Tex-int. In metastatic LNs, these response hallmarks were impaired, with immunosuppressive cellular niches. Our results identify important roles for LNs in anti-tumor immune responses in humans."

We observe extensive phenotypic variability between primary and metastatic sites and that disseminated cell phenotypes frequently deviate from the clinical disease subtype. We identify single-cell phenotypes and spatial organizations of disseminated tumor cells that are associated with patient survival and a weaker survival association for high-risk phenotypes in the primary tumor. We show that p53 and GATA3 in lymph node metastases provide prognostic information beyond clinical classifiers and can be measured with standard methods. Molecular characterization of disseminated tumor cells is an untapped source of clinically applicable prognostic information for breast cancer."

Mesothelin is a surface protein overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that shows promise as an immunotherapeutic target in phase I clinical trials. However, the immunosuppressive environment in NSCLC may limit efficacy of these therapies. We applied time-of-flight mass cytometry to examine the state of circulating mononuclear cells in fourteen patients undergoing treatment for unresectable lung cancer. Six patients had earlier stage NSCLC (I-IVA) and eight had highly advanced NSCLC (IVB). The advanced NSCLC patients relapsed with greater frequency than the earlier stage patients. Before treatment, patients with very advanced NSCLC had a greater proportion of CD14- myeloid cells than patients with earlier NSCLC. These patients also had fewer circulating natural killer (NK) cells bearing an Fc receptor, CD16, which is crucial to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. We designed a high affinity tri-specific killer engager (TriKE®) to enhance NK cytotoxicity against mesothelin+ targets in this environment. The TriKE consisted of CD16 and mesothelin binding elements linked together by IL-15. TriKE enhanced proliferation of lung cancer patient NK cells in vitro. Lung cancer lines are refractory to NK cell killing, but the TriKE enhanced cytotoxicity and cytokine production by patient NK cells when challenged with tumor. Importantly, TriKE triggered NK cell responses from patients at all stages of disease and treatment, suggesting TriKE can enhance current therapies. These pre-clinical studies suggest mesothelin-targeted TriKE has the potential to overcome the immunosuppressive environment of NSCLC to treat disease."

This important task can only be performed thanks to the broad range of mechanisms that DCs can perform to activate other immune cells. As DCs are well known for their outstanding capacity to prime and activate T cells through antigen presentation, DCs were intensively investigated during the past decades. Numerous studies have identified new DC subsets, leading to a large variety of subsets commonly separated into cDC1, cDC2, pDCs, mature DCs, Langerhans cells, monocyte-derived DCs, Axl-DCs, and several other subsets. Here, we review the specific phenotypes, functions, and localization within the tumor microenvironment (TME) of human DC subsets thanks to flow cytometry and immunofluorescence but also with the help of high-output technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing and imaging mass cytometry (IMC)."

Here we show the immune subset composition of this organ during development, by longitudinal spectral flow cytometry analysis of human foetal intestinal samples between 14 and 22 weeks of gestation. At 14 weeks, the foetal intestine is mainly populated by myeloid cells and three distinct CD3-CD7+ ILC, followed by rapid appearance of adaptive CD4+, CD8+ T and B cell subsets. Imaging mass cytometry identifies lymphoid follicles from week 16 onwards in a villus-like structure covered by epithelium and confirms the presence of Ki-67+ cells in situ within all CD3-CD7+ ILC, T, B and myeloid cell subsets. Foetal intestinal lymphoid subsets are capable of spontaneous proliferation in vitro. IL-7 mRNA is detected within both the lamina propria and the epithelium and IL-7 enhances proliferation of several subsets in vitro. Overall, these observations demonstrate the presence of immune subset-committed cells capable of local proliferation in the developing human foetal intestine, likely contributing to the development and growth of organized immune structures throughout most of the 2nd trimester, which might influence microbial colonization upon birth."

Here we use integrated systems-level analyses of fecal microbiota dynamics in rectal swabs and single-cell profiling of systemic immune and inflammatory responses in a prospective longitudinal cohort study of critically ill patients to show that the gut microbiota and systemic immunity function as an integrated metasystem, where intestinal dysbiosis is coupled to impaired host defense and increased frequency of nosocomial infections. Longitudinal microbiota analysis by 16s rRNA gene sequencing of rectal swabs and single-cell profiling of blood using mass cytometry revealed that microbiota and immune dynamics during acute critical illness were highly interconnected and dominated by Enterobacteriaceae enrichment, dysregulated myeloid cell responses and amplified systemic inflammation, with a lesser impact on adaptive mechanisms of host defense. Intestinal Enterobacteriaceae enrichment was coupled with impaired innate antimicrobial effector responses, including hypofunctional and immature neutrophils and was associated with an increased risk of infections by various bacterial and fungal pathogens. Collectively, our findings suggest that dysbiosis of an interconnected metasystem between the gut microbiota and systemic immune response may drive impaired host defense and susceptibility to nosocomial infections in critical illness."

ASPP2 is an important target in the study of drug therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study, we demonstrated that ASPP2 altered the response of HepG2 cells to usnic acid (UA) by using mRNA sequencing and CyTOF. CCK8 assay was used to detect cytotoxicity of UA on HepG2 cells. Annexin V-RPE assay, TUNEL assay, and cleaved caspase 3 assay were performed to examine the apoptotic cell death induced by UA. Transcriptomic sequencing and a single-cell mass cytometry were used to analyze the dynamic response of HepG2shcon and HepG2shASPP2 cells to UA treatment. We have demonstrated that UA could inhibit proliferation in HepG2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Apoptotic cell death was significantly induced by UA in HepG2 cells, while knocking down ASPP2 could increase the resistance of HepG2 cells to UA. Data from mRNA-Seq indicated that knockout of ASPP2 in HepG2 cells affected cell proliferation, cycle, and metabolism. ASPP2 knockdown resulted in increased stemness and decreased apoptosis of HepG2 cells under the action of UA. CyTOF analysis confirmed the above results, ASPP2 knockdown increased oncoproteins in HepG2 cells and altered response patterns of HepG2 cells to UA. Our data suggested that the natural compound UA could inhibit liver cancer HepG2 cells; meanwhile, ASPP2 knockdown could affect response patterns of HepG2 cells to UA.

The functions of caspases 3 and 7 in apoptosis execution have been widely studied over the years with multiple chemical probes for both of these enzymes. In contrast, caspase 6 seems to be largely neglected when compared to the heavily studied caspases 3 and 7. Therefore, the development of new small-molecule reagents for the selective detection and visualization of caspase 6 activity can improve our understanding of molecular circuits of apoptosis and shed new light on how they intertwine with other types of programmed cell death. In this study, we profiled caspase 6 substrate specificity at the P5 position and discovered that, similar to caspase 2, caspase 6 prefers pentapeptide substrates over tetrapeptides. Based on these data, we developed a set of chemical reagents for caspase 6 investigation, including coumarin-based fluorescent substrates, irreversible inhibitors and selective aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens). We showed that AIEgens are able to distinguish between caspase 3 and caspase 6 in vitro. Finally, we validated the efficiency and selectivity of the synthesized reagents by monitoring lamin A and PARP cleavage via mass cytometry and western blot analysis. We propose that our reagents may provide new research prospects for single-cell monitoring of caspase 6 activity to reveal its function in programmed cell death pathways."

Low-dispersion laser ablation in combination with inductively coupled plasma time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-TOFMS) provides mapping of endogenous elements with cellular resolution at unprecedented speed. Capturing the heterogeneity of the cellular population by metals only is of limited use as the cell type, functionality, and cell state remain elusive. Therefore, we expanded the toolbox of single-cell metallomics by integrating the concepts of imaging mass cytometry (IMC). This multiparametric assay successfully utilizes metal-labeled antibodies for cellular tissue profiling. One important challenge is the need to preserve the original metallome in the sample upon immunostaining. Therefore, we studied the impact of extensive labeling on the obtained endogenous cellular ionome data by quantifying elemental levels in consecutive tissue sections (with and without immunostaining) and correlating elements with structural markers and histological features. Our experiments showed that the elemental tissue distribution remained intact for selected elements such as sodium, phosphorus, and iron, while absolute quantification was precluded. We hypothesize that this integrated assay not only advances single-cell metallomics (enabling to link metal accumulation to multi-dimensional characterization of cells/cell populations), but in turn also enhances selectivity in IMC, as in selected cases, labeling strategies can be validated by elemental data. We showcase the power of this integrated single-cell toolbox using an in vivo tumor model in mice and provide mapping of the sodium and iron homeostasis as linked to different cell types and function in mouse organs (such as spleen, kidney, and liver). Phosphorus distribution maps added structural information, paralleled by the DNA intercalator visualizing the cellular nuclei. Overall, iron imaging was the most relevant addition to IMC. In tumor samples, for example, iron-rich regions correlated with high proliferation and/or located blood vessels, which are key for potential drug delivery."

Here, we reported a highly practical dual-modality imaging method that combines high-resolution immunofluorescence (IF) and high-dimensional IMC on the same tissue slide. Our computational pipeline uses the whole slide image (WSI) of IF as a spatial reference and integrates small FOVs IMC into a WSI of IMC. The high-resolution IF images enable accurate single-cell segmentation to extract robust high-dimensional IMC features for downstream analysis. We applied this method in esophageal adenocarcinoma of different stages, identified the single-cell pathology landscape via reconstruction of WSI IMC images, and demonstrated the advantage of the dual-modality imaging strategy."

Increased systemic inflammatory comorbidities and serum cytokines highlight systemic inflammation as a feature of HS. However, the specific immune cell subsets contributing to systemic and cutaneous inflammation have not been resolved. Here, we generated whole-blood immunomes by mass cytometry. We performed a meta-analysis of RNA-seq data, immunohistochemistry, and imaging mass cytometry to characterize the immunological landscape of skin lesions and perilesions from patients with HS. Blood from patients with HS exhibited lower frequencies of natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and classical (CD14+CD16-) and nonclassical (CD14-CD16+) monocytes, as well as higher frequencies of Th17 cells and intermediate (CD14+CD16+) monocytes than blood from healthy controls. Classical and intermediate monocytes from patients with HS had increased expression of skin-homing chemokine receptors. Furthermore, we identified a CD38+ intermediate monocyte subpopulation that was more abundant in the immunome of blood from patients with HS. Meta-analysis of RNA-seq data found higher CD38 expression in lesional HS skin than in perilesional skin, and markers of classical monocyte infiltration. Imaging mass cytometry showed that CD38+ classical monocytes and CD38+ monocyte-derived macrophages were more abundant in lesional HS skin. Overall, we report targeting CD38 may be worth pursuing in clinical trials."

Preprint.,Article has no keywords,"In addition to reducing fracture risk, zoledronate has been found in some studies to decrease mortality in humans and extend lifespan and healthspan in animals. Because senescent cells accumulate with aging and contribute to multiple co-morbidities, the non-skeletal actions of zoledronate could be due to senolytic (killing of senescent cells) or senomorphic (inhibition of the secretion of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype [SASP]) actions. To test this, we first performed in vitro senescence assays using human lung fibroblasts and DNA repair-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which demonstrated that zoledronate killed senescent cells with minimal effects on non-senescent cells. Next, in aged mice treated with zoledronate or vehicle for 8 weeks, zoledronate significantly reduced circulating SASP factors, including CCL7, IL-1β, TNFRSF1A, and TGFβ1 and improved grip strength. Analysis of publicly available RNAseq data from CD115+ (CSF1R/c-fms+) pre-osteoclastic cells isolated from mice treated with zoledronate demonstrated a significant downregulation of senescence/SASP genes (SenMayo). To establish that these cells are potential senolytic/senomorphic targets of zoledronate, we used single cell proteomic analysis (cytometry by time of flight [CyTOF]) and demonstrated that zoledronate significantly reduced the number of pre-osteoclastic (CD115+/CD3e-/Ly6G-/CD45R-) cells and decreased protein levels of p16, p21, and SASP markers in these cells without affecting other immune cell populations. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that zoledronate has senolytic effects in vitro and modulates senescence/SASP biomarkers in vivo . These data point to the need for additional studies testing zoledronate and/or other bisphosphonate derivatives for senotherapeutic efficacy."

Preprint.,Article has no keywords,"Glycogen Storage Disease type 1b (GSD1b) is a rare disease manifesting as hypoglycemia, recurrent infections and neutropenia, resulting from deleterious mutations in the SLC37A4 gene encoding the glucose-6-phosphate transporter. The susceptibility to infections is thought to be attributed not only to the neutrophil defect, though extensive immunophenotyping characterization is currently missing. Here we apply a systems immunology approach utilizing Cytometry by Time Of Flight (CyTOF) to map the peripheral immune landscape of 6 GSD1b patients. When compared to control subjects, those with GSD1b had a significant reduction in anti-inflammatory macrophages, CD16 + macrophages, and Natural Killer cells. Additionally, there was a preference towards a central versus an effector memory phenotype in multiple T cell populations, which may suggest that these changes stem from an inability of activated immune cell populations to undergo the appropriate switch to glycolytic metabolism in the hypoglycemic conditions associated with GSD1b. Furthermore, we identified a global reduction of CD123, CD14, CCR4, CD24 and CD11b across several populations and a multi-cluster upregulation of CXCR3, hinting at a potential role of impaired immune cell trafficking in the context of GSD1b. Taken together, our data indicates that that the immune impairment observed in GSD1b patients extends far beyond neutropenia and encompasses innate and adaptive compartments, which may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of this disorder."

Here, using single nuclei RNA sequencing and transcriptome analysis, we identified the origin, functional heterogeneity, and regulation of fibrosis-forming cells in kidney allografts with CAD. A robust technique was used to isolate individual nuclei from kidney allograft biopsies and successfully profiled 23,980 nuclei from five kidney transplant recipients with CAD and 17,913 nuclei from three patients with normal allograft function. Our analysis revealed two distinct states of fibrosis in CAD; low and high extracellular matrix (ECM) with distinct kidney cell subclusters, immune cell types, and transcriptional profiles. Imaging mass cytometry analysis confirmed increased ECM deposition at the protein level. Proximal tubular cells transitioned to an injured mixed tubular (MT1) phenotype comprised of activated fibroblasts and myofibroblast markers, generated provisional ECM which recruited inflammatory cells, and served as the main driver of fibrosis. MT1 cells in the high ECM state achieved replicative repair evidenced by dedifferentiation and nephrogenic transcriptional signatures. MT1 in the low ECM state showed decreased apoptosis, decreased cycling tubular cells, and severe metabolic dysfunction, limiting the potential for repair. Activated B, T and plasma cells were increased in the high ECM state, while macrophage subtypes were increased in the low ECM state. Intercellular communication between kidney parenchymal cells and donor-derived macrophages, detected several years post-transplantation, played a key role in injury propagation. Thus, our study identified novel molecular targets for interventions aimed to ameliorate or prevent allograft fibrogenesis in kidney transplant recipients."

Single-cell transcriptomics of lungs of patients with long COVID revealed a unique immune signature demonstrating the upregulation of key proinflammatory and innate immune effector genes CD47, IL-6, and JUN. We modeled the transition to lung fibrosis after COVID and profiled the immune response with single-cell mass cytometry in JUN mice. These studies revealed that COVID mediated chronic immune activation reminiscent to long COVID in humans. It was characterized by increased CD47, IL-6, and phospho-JUN (pJUN) expression which correlated with disease severity and pathogenic fibroblast populations. When we subsequently treated a humanized COVID lung fibrosis model by combined blockade of inflammation and fibrosis, we not only ameliorated fibrosis but also restored innate immune equilibrium indicating possible implications for clinical management of COVID lung fibrosis in patients."

A plethora of treatment strategies have been studied to determine the best possible approach to curing NPM1-mutated AML. Here, we introduce the structure and function of NPM1 and describe the application of minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring using molecular methods by means of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), next-generation sequencing (NGS), and cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) to target NPM1-mutated AML. Current drugs, now regarded as the standard of care for AML, as well as potential drugs still under development, will also be explored. This review will focus on the role of targeting aberrant NPM1 pathways such as BCL-2 and SYK; as well as epigenetic regulators (RNA polymerase), DNA intercalators (topoisomerase II), menin inhibitors, and hypomethylating agents. Aside from medication, the effects of stress on AML presentation have been reported, and some possible mechanisms outlined. Moreover, targeted strategies will be briefly discussed, not only for the prevention of abnormal trafficking and localisation of cytoplasmic NPM1 but also for the elimination of mutant NPM1 proteins. Lastly, the advancement of immunotherapy such as targeting CD33, CD123, and PD-1 will be mentioned."

Epub 2023 Feb 18.,Keywords: Mass cytometry; Mass tags; Multiplexing; Polystyrene nanoparticle; Single cells.,"Mass cytometry (MC) is an emerging bioanalytical technique for high-dimensional biomarkers interrogation simultaneously on individual cells. However, the sensitivity and multiplexed analysis ability of MC was highly restricted by the current metal chelating polymer (MCP) mass tags. Herein, a new design strategy for MC mass tags by using a commercial available and low cost classical material, polystyrene nanoparticle (PS-NP) to carry metals was reported. Unlike inorganic materials, sub-micron-grade metal-loaded polystyrene can be easily detected by MC, thus it is not essential to pursue extremely small particle size in this mass tag design strategy. An altered cell staining buffer can significantly lower the nonspecific binding (NSB) of non-functionalized PS-NPs, revealing another method to lower NSB beside surface modification. The metal doped PS-NP_Abs mass tags showed high compatibility with MCP mass tags and 5-fold higher sensitivity. By using Hf doped PS-NP_Abs as mass tags, four new MC detection channels (177Hf, 178Hf, 179Hf and 180Hf) were developed. In general, this work provides a new strategy in designing MC mass tags and lowering NSB, opening up possibility of introducing more potential MC mass tag candidates."

Despite the need for quantitative comparison, t-SNE and UMAP have largely remained visualization tools due to the lack of robust statistical approaches. Here, we have derived a statistical test for evaluating the difference between dimensionality-reduced datasets using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on the distributions of cross entropy of single cells within each dataset. As the approach uses the inter-relationship of single cells for comparison, the resulting statistic is robust and capable of identifying true biological variation. Further, the test provides a valid distance between single-cell datasets, allowing the organization of multiple samples into a dendrogram for quantitative comparison of complex datasets. These results demonstrate the largely untapped potential of dimensionality-reduction tools for biomedical data analysis beyond visualization."

Here, we used multiple ""omics"" assays (CyTOF, RNAseq, Olink) and serology to deeply characterize both global and SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity from blood of individuals with clear LC and non-LC clinical trajectories, 8 months following infection and prior to receipt of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Our analysis focused on deep phenotyping of T cells, which play important roles in immunity against SARS-CoV-2 yet may also contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Our findings demonstrate that individuals with LC exhibit systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation. This is evidenced by global differences in T cell subset distribution in ways that imply ongoing immune responses, as well as by sex-specific perturbations in cytolytic subsets. Individuals with LC harbored increased frequencies of CD4+ T cells poised to migrate to inflamed tissues, and exhausted SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells. They also harbored significantly higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and in contrast to non-LC individuals, exhibited a mis-coordination between their SARS-CoV-2-specific T and B cell responses. Collectively, our data suggest that proper crosstalk between the humoral and cellular arms of adaptive immunity has broken down in LC, and that this, perhaps in the context of persistent virus, leads to the immune dysregulation, inflammation, and clinical symptoms associated with this debilitating condition."

Here, using high-dimensional single-cell profiling, we interrogate whether the landscape of T cell states in the peripheral blood predict responses to combinatorial targeting of the OX40 costimulatory and PD-1 inhibitory pathways. Single-cell RNA sequencing and mass cytometry expose systemic and dynamic activation states of therapy-responsive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in tumor-bearing mice with expression of distinct natural killer (NK) cell receptors, granzymes, and chemokines/chemokine receptors. Moreover, similar NK cell receptor-expressing CD8+ T cells are also detected in the blood of immunotherapy-responsive cancer patients. Targeting the NK cell and chemokine receptors in tumor-bearing mice shows the functional importance of these receptors for therapy-induced anti-tumor immunity. These findings provide a better understanding of ICT and highlight the use and targeting of dynamic biomarkers on T cells to improve cancer immunotherapy."

The cellular basis of these structural changes remains unknown. Objectives: To identify biological changes in pre-TBs/TBs in COPD at single-cell resolution and determine their cellular origin. Methods: We established a novel method of distal airway dissection and performed single-cell transcriptomic profiling of 111,412 cells isolated from different airway regions of 12 healthy lung donors and pre-TBs of 5 patients with COPD. Imaging CyTOF and immunofluorescence analysis of pre-TBs/TBs from 24 healthy lung donors and 11 subjects with COPD were performed to characterize cellular phenotypes at a tissue level. Region-specific differentiation of basal cells isolated from proximal and distal airways was studied using an air-liquid interface model. Measurements and Main Results: The atlas of cellular heterogeneity along the proximal-distal axis of the human lung was assembled and identified region-specific cellular states, including SCGB3A2+ SFTPB+ terminal airway-enriched secretory cells (TASCs) unique to distal airways. TASCs were lost in COPD pre-TBs/TBs, paralleled by loss of region-specific endothelial capillary cells, increased frequency of CD8+ T cells normally enriched in proximal airways, and augmented IFN-γ signaling. Basal cells residing in pre-TBs/TBs were identified as a cellular origin of TASCs. Regeneration of TASCs by these progenitors was suppressed by IFN-γ. Conclusions: Altered maintenance of the unique cellular organization of pre-TBs/TBs, including loss of the region-specific epithelial differentiation in these bronchioles, represents the cellular manifestation and likely the cellular basis of distal airway remodeling in COPD."

To gain insight into immune dysregulation underlying early-onset AChR+ MG, we performed an in-depth analysis of peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMCs) using mass cytometry. PBMCs from 24 AChR+ MG patients without thymoma and 16 controls were stained with a panel of 37 antibodies. Using both unsupervised and supervised approaches, we observed a decrease in monocytes, for all subpopulations: classical, intermediate, and non-classical monocytes. In contrast, an increase in innate lymphoid cells 2 (ILC2s) and CD27- γδ T cells was observed. We further investigated the dysregulations affecting monocytes and γδ T cells in MG. We analyzed CD27- γδ T cells in PBMCs and thymic cells from AChR+ MG patients. We detected the increase in CD27- γδ T cells in thymic cells of MG patients suggesting that the inflammatory thymic environment might affect γδ T cell differentiation. To better understand changes that might affect monocytes, we analyzed RNA sequencing data from CD14+ PBMCs and showed a global decrease activity of monocytes in MG patients. Next, by flow cytometry, we especially confirmed the decrease affecting non-classical monocytes. In MG, as for other B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, dysregulations are well known for adaptive immune cells, such as B and T cells. Here, using single-cell mass cytometry, we unraveled unexpected dysregulations for innate immune cells. If these cells are known to be crucial for host defense, our results demonstrated that they could also be involved in autoimmunity."

Online ahead of print.,Keywords: T helper cells; cytokines; scRNAseq; single-cell genomics; single-cell mass cytometry.,"Polarized T helper cell (Th cell) responses are important determinants of host protection. Th cell subsets tailor their functional repertoire of cytokines to their cognate antigens to efficiently contribute to their clearance. In contrast, in settings of immune abrogation, these polarized cytokine patterns of Th cells can mediate tissue damage and pathology resulting in allergy or autoimmunity. Recent technological developments in single-cell genomics and proteomics as well as advances in the high-dimensional bioinformatic analysis of complex datasets have challenged the prevailing Th cell subset classification into Th1, Th2, Th17, and other subsets. Additionally, systems immunology approaches have revealed that instructive input from the peripheral tissue microenvironment can have differential effects on the overall phenotype and molecular wiring of Th cells depending on their spatial distribution. Th cells from the blood or secondary lymphoid organs are therefore expected to follow distinct rules of regulation. In this review, the functional heterogeneity of Th cell subsets will be reviewed in the context of new technological developments and T-cell compartmentalization in tissue niches. This work will especially focus on challenges to the traditional boundaries of Th cell subsets and will discuss the underlying regulatory checkpoints, which could reveal new therapeutic strategies for various immune-mediated diseases."

Affecting a confined space with crucial physiological and social functions, oral pathologies can be mutilating and drastically reduce quality of life. Despite their relevance, treatment for these diseases is often far from curative and remains vastly understudied. While multiple factors are involved in the pathogenesis of oral mucosal pathologies, the host's immune system plays a major role in the development, maintenance, and resolution of these diseases. Consequently, a precise understanding of immunological mechanisms implicated in oral mucosal pathologies is critical (1) to identify accurate, mechanistic biomarkers of clinical outcomes; (2) to develop targeted immunotherapeutic strategies; and (3) to individualize prevention and treatment approaches.

However, the mechanisms for resolving eosinophilic allergic lung inflammation triggered by inhaled allergens have not been fully elucidated. Objectives: Our objectives were to investigate the cellular mechanism of tissue-resident macrophages involved in the resolution process of eosinophilic lung inflammation. Methods: For the study, we used the institutional review board-approved protocol for human subsegmental bronchoprovocation with allergen, mouse models for allergic lung inflammation, and novel transgenic mice, including a conditional CCL26 knockout. The samples were analyzed using mass cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing, and biophysical and immunological analyses. Measurements and Main Results: We compared alveolar macrophage (AM) subsets in the BAL before and after allergen provocation. In response to provocation with inhaled allergens, the subsets of AMs are dynamically changed in humans and mice. In the steady state, the AM subset expressing CX3CR1 is a relatively small fraction in bronchoalveolar space and lung tissue but drastically increases after allergen challenges. This subset presents unique patterns of gene expression compared with classical AMs, expressing high C1q family genes. CX3CR1+ macrophages are activated by airway epithelial cell-derived CCL26 via a receptor-ligand interaction. The binding of CCL26 to the CX3CR1+ receptor induces CX3CR1+ macrophages to secrete C1q, subsequently facilitating the clearance of eosinophils. Furthermore, the depletion of CX3CR1 macrophages or CCL26 in airway epithelial cells delays the resolution of allergic lung inflammation displaying prolonged tissue eosinophilia. Conclusions: These findings indicate that the CCL26-CX3CR1 pathway is pivotal in resolving eosinophilic allergic lung inflammation."

Questions of timing and sequence have been important aspects of immunotherapies when considering immunologic mechanisms; however, most of the time the straightforward additive approach was taken. Herein, our work is the first to investigate an alternative timing of aOX40 and aPD-1 treatment in melanoma-bearing mice, and it demonstrates that sequential administration (aOX40 first, then aPD-1 following) provided superior antitumor benefits than concurrent treatment. Based on that, to further avoid the limits suffered by solution forms, we adopted pharmaceutical technologies to construct an in situ-formed physical- and chemical-dually ROS-responsive nano-in-gel platform to implement sequential and prolonged release of aPD-1 and aOX40.

Although a large number of pre-clinical and clinical studies have linked peripheral immune system alterations to stress-related disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD)3,4,5, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we show that a peripheral myeloid cell-specific proteinase, matrix metalloproteinase 8 (MMP8), is elevated in serum of subjects with MDD as well as in stress-susceptible (SUS) mice following chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). In mice, we show that this increase leads to alterations in extracellular space and neurophysiological changes in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), thereby altering social behaviour. Using a combination of mass cytometry and single-cell RNA-sequencing, we performed high-dimensional phenotyping of immune cells in circulation and brain and demonstrate that peripheral monocytes are strongly affected by stress. Both peripheral and brain-infiltrating monocytes of SUS mice showed increased Mmp8 expression following CSDS. We further demonstrate that peripheral MMP8 directly infiltrates the NAc parenchyma to control the ultrastructure of the extracellular space. Depleting MMP8 prevented stress-induced social avoidance behaviour and alterations in NAc neurophysiology and extracellular space. Collectively, these data establish a novel mechanism by which peripheral immune factors can affect central nervous system function and behaviour in the context of stress. Targeting specific peripheral immune cell-derived matrix metalloproteinases could constitute novel therapeutic targets for stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders."

However, spatial biomarker discovery is often carried out on a single patient cohort or imaging technology, limiting statistical power and increasing the likelihood of technical artifacts. In order to analyze multiple patient cohorts profiled on different platforms, we developed methods for comparative data analysis from three disparate multiplex imaging technologies: 1) cyclic immunofluorescence data we generated from 102 breast cancer patients with clinical follow-up, in addition to publicly available 2) imaging mass cytometry and 3) multiplex ion-beam imaging data. We demonstrate similar single-cell phenotyping results across breast cancer patient cohorts imaged with these three technologies and identify cellular abundance and proximity-based biomarkers with prognostic value across platforms. In multiple platforms, we identified lymphocyte infiltration as independently associated with longer survival in triple negative and high-proliferation breast tumors. Then, a comparison of nine spatial analysis methods revealed robust spatial biomarkers. In estrogen receptor-positive disease, quiescent stromal cells close to tumor were more abundant in good prognosis tumors while tumor neighborhoods of mixed fibroblast phenotypes were enriched in poor prognosis tumors. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), macrophage proximity to tumor and B cell proximity to T cells were greater in good prognosis tumors, while tumor neighborhoods of vimentin-positive fibroblasts were enriched in poor prognosis tumors. We also tested previously published spatial biomarkers in our ensemble cohort, reproducing the positive prognostic value of isolated lymphocytes and lymphocyte occupancy and failing to reproduce the prognostic value of tumor-immune mixing score in TNBC. In conclusion, we demonstrate assembly of larger clinical cohorts from diverse platforms to aid in prognostic spatial biomarker identification and validation."

Nevertheless, from a clinical perspective MS is a heterogeneous disease reflecting the heterogeneity of involved biological systems. This complexity requires advanced analysis tools at the single-cell level to discover biomarkers for better patient-group stratification. We designed a novel 44-parameter mass cytometry panel to interrogate predominantly the role of effector and regulatory subpopulations of peripheral blood myeloid subsets along with B and T-cells (excluding granulocytes) in MS, assessing three different patient cohorts: RRMS, PPMS (Primary Progressive) and Tumefactive MS patients (TMS) (n=10, 8, 14 respectively). We further subgrouped our cohort into inactive or active disease stages to capture the early underlying events in disease pathophysiology. Peripheral blood analysis showed that TMS cases belonged to the spectrum of RRMS, whereas PPMS cases displayed different features. In particular, TMS patients during a relapse stage were characterized by a specific subset of CD11c+CD14+ CD33+, CD192+, CD172+-myeloid cells with an alternative phenotype of monocyte-derived macrophages (high arginase-1, CD38, HLA-DR-low and endogenous TNF-a production). Moreover, TMS patients in relapse displayed a selective CD4 T-cell lymphopenia of cells with a Th2-like polarised phenotype. PPMS patients did not display substantial differences from healthy controls, apart from a trend toward higher expansion of NK cell subsets. Importantly, we found that myeloid cell populations are reshaped under effective disease-modifying therapy predominantly with glatiramer acetate and to a lesser extent with anti-CD20, suggesting that the identified cell signature represents a specific therapeutic target in TMS. The expanded myeloid signature in TMS patients was also confirmed by flow cytometry. Serum neurofilament light-chain levels confirmed the correlation of this myeloid cell signature with indices of axonal injury. More in-depth analysis of myeloid subsets revealed an increase of a subset of highly cytolytic and terminally differentiated NK cells in PPMS patients with leptomeningeal enhancement (active-PPMS), compared to those without (inactive-PPMS). We have identified previously uncharacterized subsets of circulating myeloid cells and shown them to correlate with distinct disease forms of MS as well as with specific disease states (relapse/remission)."

Here, we combined single-cell RNA sequencing, mass cytometry, and high-content imaging to resolve intratumoral heterogeneity of patient-derived primary RMS cultures. We show that the aggressive alveolar RMS (aRMS) subtype contains plastic muscle stem-like cells and cycling progenitors that drive tumor growth, and a subpopulation of differentiated cells that lost its proliferative potential and correlates with better outcomes. While chemotherapy eliminates cycling progenitors, it enriches aRMS for muscle stem-like cells. We screened for drugs hijacking aRMS toward clinically favorable subpopulations and identified a combination of RAF and MEK inhibitors that potently induces myogenic differentiation and inhibits tumor growth. Overall, our work provides insights into the developmental states underlying aRMS aggressiveness, chemoresistance, and progression and identifies the RAS pathway as a promising therapeutic target."

Characterization of intra- and interneoplastic heterogeneity of malignant plasmablasts and PCs revealed overexpression of the MM SET domain (MMSET), Notch-1, and CD47. Variations in upregulation of B cell signaling regulators (IFN regulatory factor 4 [IRF-4], CXCR4, B cell lymphoma 6 [Bcl-6], c-Myc, myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 [MYD88], and spliced X box-binding protein 1 [sXBP-1]) and aberrant markers (CD319, CD269, CD200, CD117, CD56, and CD28) were associated with different clinical outcomes in clonal PC subsets. In addition, prognosis was related to heterogeneity in subclonal expression of stemness markers, including neuroepithelial stem cell protein (Nestin), SRY-box transcription factor 2 (Sox2), Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF-4), and Nanog.

Anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy combined with gemcitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy has recently shown efficacy in biliary tract cancers, but responses are seen only in a minority of patients. Here, we studied the roles of anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA-4 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies when combined with gemcitabine/cisplatin and the mechanisms of treatment benefit in orthotopic murine ICC models. We evaluated the effects of the combined treatments on ICC vasculature and immune microenvironment using flow cytometry analysis, immunofluorescence, imaging mass cytometry, RNA-sequencing, qPCR, and in vivo T-cell depletion and CD8 + T-cell transfer using orthotopic ICC models and transgenic mice. Combining gemcitabine/cisplatin with anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies led to substantial survival benefits and reduction of morbidity in two aggressive ICC models, which were ICB-resistant. Gemcitabine/cisplatin treatment increased the frequency of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and normalized the ICC vessels, and when combined with dual CTLA-4/PD1 blockade, increased the number of activated CD8 + Cxcr3 + IFN-γ + T-cells. Depletion of CD8 + but not CD4 + T-cells compromised efficacy. Conversely, CD8 + T-cell transfer from Cxcr3 -/- versus Cxcr3 +/+ mice into Rag1 -/- immunodeficient mice restored the anti-tumor effect of gemcitabine/cisplatin/ICB combination therapy. Finally, rational scheduling of the ICBs (anti-CTLA-4 ""priming"") with chemotherapy and anti-PD1 therapy achieved equivalent efficacy with continuous dosing while reducing overall drug exposure. In summary, gemcitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy normalizes vessel structure, increases activated T-cell infiltration, and enhances anti-PD1/CTLA-4 immunotherapy efficacy in aggressive murine ICC. This combination approach should be clinically tested to overcome resistance to current therapies in ICC patients."

Therefore, one of the current challenges is to decipher the intra-tumor heterogeneity and especially the spatial distribution and interactions of the different cellular actors within the tumor. Preclinical mouse models are widely used to extend our understanding of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Such models are becoming more sophisticated and allow investigating questions that cannot be addressed in clinical studies. Indeed, besides studying the tumor cell interactions within their environment, mouse models allow evaluating the efficacy of new drugs and delivery approaches, treatment posology, and toxicity. Spatially resolved analyses of the intra-tumor heterogeneity require global approaches to identify and localize a large number of different cell types. For this purpose, imaging mass cytometry (IMC) is a major asset in the field of human immuno-oncology. However, the paucity of validated IMC panels to study TME in pre-clinical mouse models remains a critical obstacle to translational or basic research in oncology. Here, we validated a panel of 31 markers for studying at the single-cell level the TME and the immune landscape for discovering/characterizing cells with complex phenotypes and the interactions shaping the tumor ecosystem in mouse models."

Previous work revealed a key role for lipids particularly platelet-activating factor and sphingosine-1-phosphate in mediating UV-induced immune suppression. We therefore hypothesized that there may be other UV-induced lipids that have immune regulatory roles. To assess this, mice were exposed to an immune suppressive dose of solar-simulated UV (8 J/cm2). Lipidomic analysis identified 6 lipids (2 acylcarnitines, 2 neutral lipids, and 2 phospholipids) with significantly increased levels in the skin-draining lymph nodes of UV-irradiated mice. Imaging mass spectrometry of the lipids in combination with imaging mass cytometry identification of lymph node cell subsets indicated a preferential location of UV-induced lipids to T cell areas. In vitro co-culture of skin-draining lymph node lipids with lymphocytes showed that lipids derived from UV-exposed mice have no effect on T cell activation but significantly inhibited T cell proliferation, indicating that the lipids play an immune regulatory role. These studies are important first steps in identifying novel lipids that contribute to UV-mediated immune suppression."

Recent advances in highly multiplexed imaging, including imaging mass cytometry (IMC), capture spatially resolved, high-dimensional maps that quantify dozens of disease-relevant biomarkers at single-cell resolution, that contain potential to inform patient-specific prognosis. Existing automated methods for predicting survival, on the other hand, typically do not leverage spatial phenotype information captured at the single-cell level. Furthermore, there is no end-to-end method designed to leverage the rich information in whole IMC images and all marker channels, and aggregate this information with clinical data in a complementary manner to predict survival with enhanced accuracy. To that end, we present a deep multimodal graph-based network (DMGN) with two modules: (1) a multimodal graph-based module that considers relationships between spatial phenotype information in all image regions and all clinical variables adaptively, and (2) a clinical embedding module that automatically generates embeddings specialised for each clinical variable to enhance multimodal aggregation. We demonstrate that our modules are consistently effective at improving survival prediction performance using two public breast cancer datasets, and that our new approach can outperform state-of-the-art methods in survival prediction."

Here we sought to further understand the effects of idelalisib and duvelisib in vitro, and demonstrate that both idelalisib and duvelisib can inhibit T cell proliferation as well as Th1 and Treg differentiation in vitro, while promoting Th2 and Th17 differentiation. We further demonstrate directly using intracellular flow cytometry that autoimmune toxicity in patients is associated with higher absolute numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells with Th17 differentiation in peripheral blood prior to therapy, and that gastrointestinal tissues from patients with active autoimmune complications of PI3Kδ inhibitors show infiltration with Th17+ T cells. These same tissues show depletion of Tregs as compared to CLL patients without toxicity, suggesting that loss of Tregs may be permissive for Th17 activation to lead to autoimmune toxicity.

MRI and 18FDG PET imaging were performed temporally at baseline, 4, 24, 48, and 72 hr post Prime and Prime-Boost vaccination in hindlimb with Cytomegalovirus (CMV) gB and pentamer proteins formulated with AS01, LNP encapsulated CMV gB protein-encoding SAM (CMV SAM), AS01 or with LNP carrier controls. Both CMV AS01 and CMV SAM resulted in a rapid MRI and PET signal enhancement in hindlimb muscles and draining popliteal lymph node reflecting innate and possibly adaptive immune response. MRI signal enhancement and total 18FDG uptake observed in the hindlimb was greater in the CMV SAM vs CMV AS01 group (↑2.3 - 4.3-fold in AUC) and the MRI signal enhancement peak and duration were temporally shifted right in the CMV SAM group following both Prime and Prime-Boost administration. While cytokine profiles were similar among groups, there was good temporal correlation only between IL-6, IL-13, and MRI/PET endpoints. Imaging mass cytometry was performed on lymph node sections at 72 hr post Prime and Prime-Boost vaccination to characterize the innate and adaptive immune cell signatures. Cell proximity analysis indicated that each follicular dendritic cell interacted with more follicular B cells in the CMV AS01 than in the CMV SAM group, supporting the stronger humoral immune response observed in the CMV AS01 group. A strong correlation between lymph node MRI T2 value and nearest-neighbor analysis of follicular dendritic cell and follicular B cells was observed (r=0.808, P<0.01). These data suggest that spatiotemporal imaging data together with AI/ML approaches may help establish whether in vivo imaging biomarkers can predict local and systemic immune responses following vaccination."

It allows for simultaneous interrogation of more than 40 different molecular markers, without the need for spectral compensation, which significantly augments the ability of cytometry to evaluate complex cellular systems and processes. Currently, different multiparametric single-cell analysis approaches are being widely adopted to interrogate the human tumor microenvironment.

Previous studies have focused on the resident macrophage, infiltrating monocyte, and neutrophil responses to monosodium urate crystal, yet the mechanisms of the potential involvement of other immune cells remain largely unknown. In this study, we enrolled seven gout patients and five age-matched healthy individuals and applied single-cell mass cytometry to study the distribution of immune cell subsets in peripheral blood. To our knowledge, our study reveals the immune cell profiles of gout at different stages for the first time. We identified many immune cell subsets that are dysregulated in gout and promote gouty inflammation, especially those highly expressing CCR4 and OX40 (TNFR superfamily member 4), including CCR4+OX40+ monocytes, CCR4+OX40+CD56high NK cells, CCR4+OX40+CD4+ NK T cells, and CCR4+CD38+CD4+ naïve T cells. Notably, the plasma levels of CCL17 and CCL22, measured by ELISA, increased in the acute phase of gout and declined in the interval. We also found a clue that Th2-type immune responses may participate in gout pathology. Moreover, the subset of granzyme B+ (GZMB+) CD38+ NK cells is positively correlated with serum urea acid level, and another two γδT subsets, GZMB+CD161+ γδT cells and GZMB+CCR5+ γδT cells, are negatively correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate. In sum, gouty arthritis is not a disease simply mediated by macrophages; multiple types of immune cell may be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Future research needs to shift attention to other immune cell subsets, such as NK cells and T cells, which will facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic targets."

However, as manual gating relies on previous biological knowledge, few marker combinations are often assessed. This results in complex phenotypes with the potential for biological relevance being overlooked. Here, we present PhenoComb, an R package that allows agnostic exploration of phenotypes by assessing all combinations of markers. PhenoComb uses signal intensity thresholds to assign markers to discrete states (e.g. negative, low, high) and then counts the number of cells per sample from all possible marker combinations in a memory-safe manner. Time and disk space are the only constraints on the number of markers evaluated. PhenoComb also provides several approaches to perform statistical comparisons, evaluate the relevance of phenotypes and assess the independence of identified phenotypes. PhenoComb allows users to guide analysis by adjusting several function arguments, such as identifying parent populations of interest, filtering of low-frequency populations and defining a maximum complexity of phenotypes to evaluate. We have designed PhenoComb to be compatible with a local computer or server-based use."

In suspension mass cytometry, cells are stained with stable heavy-atom isotope-tagged reagents, and then the cells are nebulized into an inductively coupled plasma time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ICP-TOF-MS) instrument. In imaging mass cytometry, a pulsed laser is used to ablate ca. 1 μm2 spots of a tissue section. The plume is then transferred to the CyTOF, generating an image of biomarker expression. Similar measurements are possible with multiplexed ion bean imaging (MIBI). The unit mass resolution of the ICP-TOF-MS detector allows for multiparametric analysis of (in principle) up to 130 different parameters. Currently available reagents, however, allow simultaneous measurement of up to 50 biomarkers. As new reagents are developed, the scope of information that can be obtained by mass cytometry continues to increase, particularly due to the development of new small molecule reagents which enable monitoring of active biochemistry at the cellular level. This review summarizes the history and current state of mass cytometry reagent development and elaborates on areas where there is a need for new reagents. Additionally, this review provides guidelines on how new reagents should be tested and how the data should be presented to make them most meaningful to the mass cytometry user community."

Here, we characterized tumor-infiltrating T-cell populations in patients with PDAC using cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) and single-cell RNA sequencing. T cells were the predominant immune cell subset observed within tumors. Over 30% of CD4+ T cells expressed a CCR6+CD161+ Th17 phenotype and 17% displayed an activated regulatory T-cell profile. Large populations of CD8+ tissue-resident memory (TRM) T cells were also present and expressed high levels of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and TIGIT. A population of putative tumor-reactive CD103+CD39+ T cells was also observed within the CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes population. The expression of PD-1 ligands was limited largely to hemopoietic cells whilst TIGIT ligands were expressed widely within the tumor microenvironment. Programmed death-ligand 1 and CD155 were expressed within the T-cell area of ectopic lymphoid structures and colocalized with PD-1+TIGIT+ CD8+ T cells. Combinatorial anti-PD-1 and TIGIT blockade enhanced IFNγ secretion and proliferation of T cells in the presence of PD-1 and TIGIT ligands. As such, we showed that the PDAC microenvironment is characterized by the presence of substantial populations of TRM cells with an exhausted PD-1+TIGIT+ phenotype where dual checkpoint receptor blockade represents a promising avenue for future immunotherapy."

Although this inflammation is often limited to specific target tissues, it remains yet to be explored whether distinct affected sites are infiltrated with the same, persistent T cell clones. Here, we performed CyTOF analysis and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to study immune cell composition and (hyper-)expansion of circulating and joint-derived Tregs and non-Tregs in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). We studied different joints affected at the same time, as well as over the course of relapsing-remitting disease. We found that the composition and functional characteristics of immune infiltrates are strikingly similar between joints within one patient, and observed a strong overlap between dominant T cell clones, especially Treg, of which some could also be detected in circulation and persisted over the course of relapsing-remitting disease. Moreover, these T cell clones were characterized by a high degree of sequence similarity, indicating the presence of TCR clusters responding to the same antigens. These data suggest that in localized autoimmune disease, there is autoantigen-driven expansion of both Teffector and Treg clones that are highly persistent and are (re)circulating. These dominant clones might represent interesting therapeutic targets."

However, the pathophysiology of DN, especially the risk factors for early onset remains elusive. Increasing evidence has revealed the role of the innate immune system in developing DN, but relatively little is known about early immunological change that proceeds from overt DN. Herein, this work aims to investigate the immune-driven pathogenesis of DN using mass cytometry (CyTOF). The peripheral blood mononuclear lymphocytes (PBMC) from 6 patients with early-stage nephropathy and 7 type II diabetes patients without nephropathy were employed in the CyTOF test. A panel that contains 38 lineage markers was designed to monitor immune protein levels in PBMC. The unsupervised clustering analysis was performed to profile the proportion of individual cells. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) was used to visualize the differences in DN patients' immune phenotypes. Comprehensive immune profiling revealed substantial immune system alterations in the early onset of DN, including the significant decline of B cells and the marked increase of monocytes. The level of CXCR3 was dramatically reduced in the different immune cellular subsets. The CyTOF data classified the fine-grained differential immune cell subsets in the early stage of DN. Innovatively, we identified several significant changed T cells, B cell, and monocyte subgroups in the early-stage DN associated with several potential biomarkers for developing DN, such as CTLA-4, CXCR3, PD-1, CD39, CCR4, and HLA-DR. Correlation analysis further demonstrated the robust relationship between above immune cell biomarkers and clinical parameters in the DN patients. Therefore, we provided a convincible view of understanding the immune-driven early pathogenesis of DN. Our findings exhibited that patients with DN are more susceptible to immune system disorders. The classification of fine-grained immune cell subsets in this present research might provide novel targets for the immunotherapy of DN."

However, the distribution and functional changes in immune cells of the maternal-placental interface have not been well characterized. Herein, cytometry by time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CyTOF) was used to investigate the immune atlas at the decidua, which was obtained from four PE patients and four healthy controls. Six superclusters were identified, namely, T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, granulocytes, and others. B cells were significantly decreased in the PE group, among which the reduction in CD27+CD38+ regulatory B cell (Breg)-like cells may stimulate immune activation in PE. The significantly increased migration of B cells could be linked to the significantly overexpressed chemokine C-X-C receptor 5 (CXCR5) in the PE group, which may result in the production of excessive autoantibodies and the pathogenesis of PE. A subset of T cells, CD11c+CD8+ T cells, was significantly decreased in PE and might lead to sustained immune activation in PE patients. NK cells were ultimately separated into four subsets. The significant reduction in a novel subset of NK cells (CD56-CD49a-CD38+) in PE might have led to the failure to suppress inflammation at the maternal-fetal interface during PE progression. Moreover, the expression levels of functional markers were significantly altered in the PE group, which also inferred that shifts in the decidual immune state contributed to the development of PE and might serve as potential treatment targets. This is a worthy attempt to elaborate the differences in the phenotype and function of CD45+ immune cells in the decidua between PE and healthy pregnancies by CyTOF, which contributes to understand the pathogenesis of PE, and the altered cell subsets and markers may inspire the immune modulatory therapy for PE."

Cyclosporine is often used to treat non-severe AA, which demonstrates a more heterogeneous condition than severe AA. The response rate to cyclosporine is only around 50% in non-severe AA. To better predict response to cyclosporine and pinpoint who is the appropriate candidate for cyclosporine, we performed phenotypic and functional T cell immune signature at single cell level by mass cytometry from 30 patients with non-severe AA. Unexpectedly, non-significant differences of T cell subsets were observed between AA and healthy control or cyclosporine-responder and non-responders. Interestingly, when screening the expression of co-inhibitory molecules, T cell trafficking mediators, and cytokines, we found an increase of cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) on T cells in response to cyclosporine and a lower level of CTLA-4 on CD8+ T cells was correlated to hematologic response. Moreover, a decreased expression of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) on naive T cells and a lower level of interleukin-9 (IL-9) on T helpers also predicted a better response to cyclosporine, respectively. Therefore, the T cell immune signature, especially in CTAL-4, S1P1, and IL-9, has a predictive value for response to cyclosporine. Collectively, our study implies that immune signature analysis of T cell by mass cytometry is a useful tool to make a strategic decision on cyclosporine treatment of AA."

Using single-cell proteomics by mass cytometry, we find disrupted regulation of humoral immunity in COVID-19 patients, with a sex-biased loss of circulating follicular regulatory T cells (cTfr) at a significantly greater rate in male patients. In addition, a male sex-associated cellular network of T-peripheral helper, plasma blasts, proliferating and extrafollicular/atypical CD11c+ memory B cells was strongly positively correlated with neutralizing antibody concentrations and negatively correlated with cTfr frequency. These results suggest that sex-specific differences to the balance of cTfr and a network of extrafollicular antibody production-associated cell types may be a key factor in the altered humoral immune responses between male and female COVID-19 patients."

We also explored the mechanisms through which inflammation and fibrosis might affect prognosis. Methods: Clinicopathological data were retrospectively analyzed from 293 patients with non-cirrhotic HBV-associated HCC who were treated at our institution by curative resection from 2012 to 2017. Based on the Scheuer score system, patients were classified into those showing mild or moderate-to-severe inflammation and fibrosis. Rates of overall and recurrence-free survival were compared between the groups using Kaplan-Meier curves, and survival predictors were identified using Cox regression. Using tumor and para-tumor tissues from independent samples of patients with non-cirrhotic HBV-associated HCC who were treated at our institution by curative resection from 2018 to 2019, we performed next-generation sequencing and time-of-flight cytometry (CyTOF) to examine the influence of inflammation and fibrosis on gene expression and immune cell infiltration. Results: In the analysis of the 293 patients, those with mild inflammation and fibrosis showed significantly better overall and recurrence-free survival than those with moderate-to-severe inflammation and fibrosis. Multivariate Cox regression confirmed that moderate-to-severe inflammation and fibrosis were independent risk factors for worse survival. RNA sequencing and CyTOF showed that more severe inflammation and fibrosis were associated with stronger invasion and migration by hepatocytes. In cancerous tissues, the biological processes of cell proliferation were upregulated, the signaling pathways promoting tumor growth were activated, the proportion of Th17 cells promoting tumor progression was increased, and CD8+ T cells expressed higher levels of PD-L1. In para-cancerous tissues, biological processes of immune response and cell chemotaxis were downregulated, and the proportion of tumor-killing immune cells was decreased. Conclusion: Worse inflammation and fibrosis in non-cirrhotic HBV-associated HCC is associated with worse prognosis, which may reflect more aggressive tumor behavior and an immunosuppressed, pro-metastatic tumor microenvironment."

Single-cell analysis based on organic mass spectrometry has received great attention for its unique ability to profile single-cell metabolome, but the influence of cell cycle on cellular metabolome heterogeneity has been overlooked until now due to the lack of a compatible cell cycle discrimination method. Here, we report a robust protocol based on the combination of three small molecular indicators, consisting of two small molecular labels (Hoechst and docetaxel) and one cellular endogenous compound [phosphocholine (34:1)], to discriminate single cells at different cycle stages in real time by organic mass cytometry. More than 6000 HeLa cells were acquired by an improved organic mass cytometry system to build a cell cycle differentiation model. The model successfully discriminated single HeLa cells, SCC7, and Hep G2 cells, at G0/G1, S, and G2/M stages with larger than 85% sensitivity and larger than 89% specificity. Along with cell cycle discrimination, obvious heterogeneity of amino acids, nucleotides, energy metabolic intermediates, and phospholipids was observed among single cells at different cycle stages by this protocol, further demonstrating the necessity of cell cycle discrimination for cellular metabolome heterogeneity research and the potential of more endogenous small molecular compounds for cell cycle discrimination."

Epub 2023 Jan 31.,Keywords: acute erythroid leukemia; acute myeloid leukemia; mass cytometry.,"Acute erythroid leukemia (AEL) is a disease continuum between Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with the cellular hallmark of uncontrolled proliferation and impaired differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells. First described by Giovanni di Guglielmo in 1917 AEL accounts for less than 5% of all de novo AML cases. There have been efforts to characterize AEL at a molecular level, describing recurrent alterations in TP53, NPM1 and FLT3 genes. A genomic analysis of AEL cases confirmed its complexity. Despite these advances, the biology underlying erythroid proliferations remains unclear and the prognosis is dismal with a median survival of only 3 months for pure erythroid leukemia (PEL). Marker combinations suitable for the identification and characterization of leukemic stem cell (LSC) candidates, monitoring measurable residual disease (MRD) during chemotherapy treatment and the development of innovative targeted therapies are missing. Here, we developed a mass cytometry panel for an in-depth characterization of erythroid and myeloid blast cell populations from human AEL bone marrow samples in comparison to other AML subtypes and healthy counterparts. A total of 8 AEL samples were analyzed and compared to 28 AML samples from different molecular subtypes, healthy bone marrow counterparts (n = 5) and umbilical cord blood (n = 6) using high-dimensional mass cytometry. Identification of erythroid and myeloid blast populations in high-dimensional mass cytometry data enabled a refined view on erythroblast differentiation stages present in AEL erythroid blasts and revealed immunophenotypical profiles specific to AEL. Profiling of phenotypic LSCs revealed aberrant erythroid marker expression in the CD34+ CD38- stem cell compartment. In addition, the identification of novel candidate surface marker combinations and aberrancies might enhance clinical diagnostics of AEL. We present a high-parameter mass cytometry approach feasible for immunophenotypical analysis of blast and stem cell populations in myeloid neoplasms with erythroid predominance laying the foundation for more precise experimental approaches in the future."

Its diagnosis at advanced stage compounded with its excessive genomic and cellular heterogeneity make curative treatment challenging. Two critical therapeutic challenges to overcome are carboplatin resistance and lack of response to immunotherapy. Carboplatin resistance results from diverse cell autonomous mechanisms which operate in different combinations within and across tumors. The lack of response to immunotherapy is highly likely to be related to an immunosuppressive HGSOC tumor microenvironment which overrides any clinical benefit. Results from a number of studies, mainly using transcriptomics, indicate that the immune tumor microenvironment (iTME) plays a role in carboplatin response. However, in patients receiving treatment, the exact mechanistic details are unclear. During the past decade, multiplex single-cell proteomic technologies have come to the forefront of biomedical research. Mass cytometry or cytometry by time-of-flight, measures up to 60 parameters in single cells that are in suspension. Multiplex cellular imaging technologies allow simultaneous measurement of up to 60 proteins in single cells with spatial resolution and interrogation of cell-cell interactions. This review suggests that functional interplay between cell autonomous responses to carboplatin and the HGSOC immune tumor microenvironment could be clarified through the application of multiplex single-cell proteomic technologies. We conclude that for better clinical care, multiplex single-cell proteomic technologies could be an integral component of multimodal biomarker development that also includes genomics and radiomics. Collection of matched samples from patients before and on treatment will be critical to the success of these efforts."

Single-cell data has already resulted in the development of human and model species cell atlases, identifying different cell types within a tissue, further facilitating the characterization of tumor heterogeneity, and providing insight into treatment resistance. Research discussed in this review demonstrates that distinct cell populations express drug metabolizing enzymes to different extents, indicating there may be variability in drug metabolism not only between organs, but within tissue types. Additionally, we put forth the concept that single-cell analyses can be used to expose underlying variability in cellular response to drugs, providing a unique examination of drug efficacy, toxicity, and metabolism. We will outline several of these techniques: single-cell RNA-sequencing and mass cytometry to characterize and distinguish different cell types, single-cell proteomics to quantify drug metabolizing enzymes and characterize cellular responses to drug, capillary electrophoresis-ultrasensitive laser-induced fluorescence detection and single-probe single-cell mass spectrometry for detection of drugs, and others. Emerging single-cell technologies such as these can comprehensively characterize heterogeneity in both cell-type-specific drug metabolism and response to treatment, enhancing progress toward personalized and precision medicine. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Recent technological advances have enabled the analysis of gene expression and protein levels in single cells. These types of analyses are important to investigating mechanisms that cannot be elucidated on a bulk level, primarily due to the variability of cell populations within biological systems. Here, we summarize cell-type-specific drug metabolism and how pharmacologists can utilize single-cell approaches to obtain a comprehensive understanding of drug metabolism and cellular heterogeneity in response to drugs."

Although some failures may be attributable to CD19 loss, mechanisms of CD19-independent, leukemia intrinsic resistance to CD19-CAR remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that PNR leukemias are distinct compared to primary sensitive (PS) leukemias and that these differences are present prior to treatment. We utilized a multi-omic approach to investigate this in 14 patients (7 PNR and 7 PS) enrolled in the PLAT-02 trial at Seattle Children's Hospital. Long-read PacBio sequencing identified one PNR where 47% of CD19 transcripts had exon 2 skipping, but other samples lacked CD19 transcript abnormalities. Epigenetic profiling discovered DNA hypermethylation at genes targeted by polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in embryonic stem cells. Similarly, ATAC-seq revealed reduced accessibility at these PRC2 target genes with a gain in accessibility of regions characteristic of hematopoietic stem cells and multi-lineage progenitors in PNR. Single cell RNA-seq and CyTOF analyses identified leukemic subpopulations expressing multi-lineage markers and decreased antigen presentation in PNR. We thus describe the association of a Stem Cell Epigenome (SCE) with primary resistance to CD19-CAR therapy. Future trials incorporating these biomarkers, with addition of multi-specific CAR T-cells targeting against leukemic stem cell or myeloid antigens, and/or combined epigenetic therapy to disrupt this distinct stem cell epigenome may improve outcomes of patients with B-ALL."

While distinct immune cell infiltration is a known hallmark of the disease, its role in the onset and development of lipedema remains unclear. To analyze the macrophage composition and involved signaling pathways, anatomically matched lipedema and control tissue samples were collected intra-operatively from gender- and BMI-matched patients, and the Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) was used for Cytometry by Time-of-Flight (CyTOF) and RNA sequencing. The phenotypic characterization of the immune component of lipedema versus control SVF using CyTOF revealed significantly increased numbers of CD163 macrophages. To gain further insight into this macrophage composition and molecular pathways, RNA sequencing of isolated CD11b+ cells was performed. The analysis suggested a significant modification of distinct gene ontology clusters in lipedema, including cytokine-mediated signaling activity, interleukin-1 receptor activity, extracellular matrix organization, and regulation of androgen receptor signaling. As distinct macrophage populations are known to affect adipose tissue differentiation and metabolism, we evaluated the effect of M2 to M1 macrophage polarization in lipedema using the selective PI3Kγ inhibitor IPI-549. Surprisingly, the differentiation of adipose tissue-derived stem cells with conditioned medium from IPI-549 treated SVF resulted in a significant decreased accumulation of lipids in lipedema versus control SVF. In conclusion, our results indicate that CD163+ macrophages are a critical component in lipedema and re-polarization of lipedema macrophages can normalize the differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells in vitro evaluated by the cellular lipid accumulation. These data open a new chapter in understanding lipedema pathophysiology and may indicate potential treatment options."

The antibody panel includes markers to identify hepatocytes (E-cadherin, HNF4α (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha), Arginase-1), liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs; CD206), Kupffer cells (F4/80, CD206), neutrophils (Ly6G, CD11b), bone marrow derived myeloid cells (BMDMs; CD11b), cholangiocytes (E-cadherin high), endothelial cells (CD31, α-SMA), plasmacytoid dendritic cells (CD317), B cells (CD19), T cells (CD3e, CD4, CD8a), NK cells (CD161) as well markers of cell activation (CD44, CD74), proliferation (Ki-67) and to aid in cell segmentation (Pan-Actin, E-cadherin, histone H3). The panel has been tested in other mouse tissues, namely the spleen, colon and lung, and therefore is likely to work across various mouse FFPE samples of interest. It has not been tested using human samples, frozen samples or in suspension mass cytometry because FFPE treatment profoundly changes epitope conformation. In summary, this panel is a powerful tool for pre-clinical research to determine cellular abundance and spatial distribution within mouse tissues and serves as a scaffold, to which more targets can be added for project specific requirements."

Although lymphocytes are key mediators of inflammation, functional specialization of T cells in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has not been effectively described. Here, we performed deep profiling of T cells in the intestinal mucosa of IBD and identified a CD4+ tissue-resident memory T cell (Trm) subset that is increased in Crohn's disease (CD) showing unique inflammatory properties. Functionally and transcriptionally distinct CD4+ Trm subsets are observed in the inflamed gut mucosa, among which a CD-specific CD4+ Trm subset, expressing CD161 and CCR5 along with CD103, displays previously unrecognized pleiotropic signatures of innate and effector activities. These inflammatory features are further enhanced by their spatial proximity to gut epithelial cells. Furthermore, the CD-specific CD4+ Trm subset is the most predominant producer of type 1 inflammatory cytokines upon various stimulations among all CD4+ T cells, suggesting that the accumulation of this T cell subset is a pathological hallmark of CD. Our results provide comprehensive insights into the pathogenesis of IBD, paving the way for decoding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease."

A set of 11 types of lanthanide-encoded microbeads were synthesized by two-stage dispersion polymerization as classifier candidates for the assay. These beads were then decorated with different Abs on the surface to capture the target cytokines in solution. Gold nanoparticles were employed as reporters to identify the binding of target cytokines on the classifier surface. As a proof-of-concept study, we first developed four-plex and nine-plex assays of mixtures of cytokines in standard solutions. The MC signal intensities of these immunoassays were responsive to the concentration differences in the standard solutions with high detection sensitivities at low analyte concentrations. Finally, we examined a sample of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with the nine-plex assay, comparing an unstimulated sample with a sample stimulated to promote cytokine secretion."

However, the cellular mechanisms of TP53 mutations are complicated, yet well-defined, but their clinical prognostic value in the management of BLCA remains controversial. This study aimed to explore the role of TP53 mutation in regulating the tumor microenvironment (TME), elucidate the effects of TP53 activity on BLCA prognosis and immunotherapy response. Methods: A TP53-related signature based on TP53-induced and TP53-repressed genes was used to construct a TP53 activity-related score and classifier. The abundance of different immune cell types was determined using CIBERSORT to estimate immune cell infiltration. Moreover, the heterogeneity of the tumor immune microenvironment between the high and low TP53 score groups was further evaluated using single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) and imaging mass cytometry (IMC). Moreover, pathway enrichment analysis was performed to explore the differential biological functions between tumor epithelial cells with high and low TP53 activity scores. Finally, the receptor-ligand interactions between immune cells and tumor epithelial cells harboring distinct TP53 activity were analyzed by single-cell RNA-sequencing. Results: The TP53 activity-related gene signature differentiated well between TP53 functional retention and inactivation in BLCA. BLCA patients with low TP53 scores had worse survival prognosis, more TP53 mutations, higher grade, and stronger lymph node metastasis than those with high TP53 scores. Additionally, CyTOF and IMC analyses revealed that BLCA patients with low TP53 scores exhibited a potent immunosuppressive TME. Consistently, single-cell sequencing results showed that tumor epithelial cells with low TP53 scores were significantly associated with high cell proliferation and stemness abilities and strongly interacted with immunosuppressive receptor-ligand pairs. Conclusion: BLCA patients with low TP53 scores have a worse prognosis and a more immunosuppressive TME. This TP53 activity-related signature can serve as a potential prognostic signature for predicting the immune response, which may facilitate the development of new strategies for immunotherapy in BLCA."

These highly heterogeneous malignancies arise in different sites of the Central Nervous System (CNS), carrying distinctive molecular alterations and clinical outcomes (inter-tumor heterogeneity). Moreover, deep cellular and molecular profiling studies highlighted the coexistence of genetically and phenotypically different subpopulations within the same tumor mass (intra-tumor heterogeneity). Despite the recent advances made in the field, the marked heterogeneity of PDHGGs still impedes the development of effective targeted therapies and the identification of suitable biomarkers. In order to fill the existing gap, we used mass cytometry to dissect PDHGG inter- and intra-heterogeneity. This is one of the most advanced technologies of the ""-omics"" era that, using antibodies conjugated to heavy metals, allows the simultaneous measurement of more than 40 markers at single-cell level. To this end, we analyzed eight PDHGG patient-derived cell lines from different locational and molecular subgroups. By using a panel of 15 antibodies, directly conjugated to metals or specifically customized to detect important histone variants, significant differences were highlighted in the expression of the considered antigens. The single-cell multiparametric approach realized has deepened our understanding of PDHGG, confirming a high degree of intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity and identifying some antigens that could represent useful biomarkers for the specific PDHGG locational or molecular subgroups."

In breast cancer, fibrosis is a histopathologic criterion for invasive cancer and poor survival that results from inflammatory factors and remodeling of the extracellular matrix to produce an immune tolerant microenvironment. To determine whether tolerance is associated with the immune checkpoint, Programmed Cell Death 1 (PD-1), NeuT/ATTAC mice, a conditional model of mammary fibrosis that we recently developed, were administered a murine-specific anti-PD-1 mAb related to pembrolizumab, and drug response was monitored by tumor development, imaging mass cytometry, immunohistochemistry and tumor gene expression by RNAseq. Tumor progression in NeuT/ATTAC mice was unaffected by weekly injection of anti-PD-1 over four months. Insensitivity to anti-PD-1 was associated with several processes, including increased tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), fibroblast proliferation, an enhanced extracellular matrix and the Wnt signaling pathway, including increased expression of Fzd5, Wnt5a, Vimentin, Mmp3, Col2a1 and Tgfβ1. These results suggest potential therapeutic avenues that may enhance PD-1 immune checkpoint sensitivity, including the use of tumor microenvironment targeted agents and Wnt pathway inhibitors."

To dissect the pathophysiology of WM, we evaluated clonal cells by mapping of B cell lymphomagenesis with adaptive and innate immune tumor microenvironment (TME) in the BM of WM patients using mass cytometry (CyTOF). In-depth immunophenotypic profiling of WM cells exhibited profound expansion of clonal cells in both unswitched and switched memory B cells and also plasma cells with aberrant expression variations. WM B lymphomagenesis was associated with reduction of most B cell precursors assessed with the same clonally restricted light chain and phenotypic changes. The immune TME was infiltrated by mature monocytes, neutrophils and adaptive T cells, preferentially subsets of effector T helper, effector CTL and effector memory CTL cells that were associated with superior overall survival (OS), in contrast to progenitors of T cells and myeloid/monocytic lineage subsets that were suppressed in WM cohort. Moreover, decrease in immature B and NKT cells was related to worse OS in WM patients. Innate and adaptive immune subsets of WM TME were modulated by immune checkpoints, including PD-1/PD-L1&PD-L2, TIGIT/PVR, CD137/CD137-L, CTLA-4, BTLA and KIR expression.

Here, we study CD4+ TILs in human lung and colorectal cancers and observe that non-Treg CD4+ TILs average more than 70% of total CD4+ TILs in both cancer types. Leveraging high dimensional analyses including mass cytometry, we reveal that CD4+ TILs are phenotypically heterogeneous, within each tumor and across patients. Consistently, we find different subsets of CD4+ TILs showing characteristics of effectors, tissue resident memory (Trm) or exhausted cells (expressing PD-1, CTLA-4 and CD39). In both cancer types, the frequencies of CD39- non-Treg CD4+ TILs strongly correlate with frequencies of CD39- CD8+ TILs, which we and others have previously shown to be enriched for cells specific for cancer-unrelated antigens (bystanders). Ex-vivo, we demonstrate that CD39- CD4+ TILs can be specific for cancer-unrelated antigens, such as HCMV epitopes.

In this study, we performed deep profiling of peripheral blood (PB) cells from patients with CLL and AML before and after short-term treatment with venetoclax using mass cytometry (cytometry by time of flight) and found no impact on the concentrations of key T-cell subsets or their expression of checkpoint molecules. We also analyzed PB from patients with breast cancer receiving venetoclax long-term using a single-cell multiomics approach (cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing) and functional assays. We found significant depletion of B-cell populations with low expression of MCL-1 relative to other immune cells, attended by extensive transcriptomic changes. By contrast, there was less impact on circulating T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, with no changes in their subset composition, transcriptome, or function following venetoclax treatment.

In addition to restricting proliferation of damaged cells, increasing evidence suggests that cellular senescence also has distinct modulatory effects during wound healing and fibrosis. Yet, a direct role of senescent cells during tissue formation beyond paracrine signaling remains unknown. We here report how individual modules of the senescence program differentially influence cell mechanics and ECM expression with relevance for tissue formation. We compared DNA damage-mediated and DNA damage-independent senescence which was achieved through over-expression of either p16Ink4a or p21Cip1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in primary human skin fibroblasts. Cellular senescence modulated focal adhesion size and composition. All senescent cells exhibited increased single cell forces which led to an increase in tissue stiffness and contraction in an in vitro 3D tissue formation model selectively for p16 and p21-overexpressing cells. The mechanical component was complemented by an altered expression profile of ECM-related genes including collagens, lysyl oxidases, and MMPs. We found that particularly the lack of collagen and lysyl oxidase expression in the case of DNA damage-mediated senescence foiled their intrinsic mechanical potential. These observations highlight the active mechanical role of cellular senescence during tissue formation as well as the need to synthesize a functional ECM network capable of transferring and storing cellular forces."

An evolving challenge is the requirement for ever-increasing cohort sizes as the dimensionality of datasets grows. We propose a deep learning model derived from a novel pipeline of optimal temporal cell matching and overcomplete autoencoders that uses data from a small subset of patients to learn to forecast an entire patient's immune response in a high dimensional space from one timepoint to another. In our analysis of 1.08 million cells from patients pre- and post-surgical intervention, we demonstrate that the generated patient-specific data are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to real patient data by demonstrating fidelity, diversity, and usefulness."

In this study of 90 ICU COVID-19 patients, we evaluated serum levels of four cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10 and TNFα) as well as standard clinical and laboratory measurements. On 42 of these patients (binned into Initial and Replication Cohorts), we further performed CyTOF-based deep immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with a panel of 38 antibodies. All measurements and patient samples were taken at time of ICU admission and retrospectively linked to patient clinical outcomes through statistical approaches. These analyses resulted in the definition of a new measure of patient clinical outcome: patients who will recover after short ICU stays (< 6 days) and those who will subsequently die or recover after long ICU stays (≥6 days). Based on these clinical outcome categories, we identified blood prognostic biomarkers that, at time of ICU admission, prospectively distinguish, with 91% sensitivity and 91% specificity (positive likelihood ratio 10.1), patients in the two clinical outcome groups. This is achieved through a tiered evaluation of serum IL-10 and targeted immunophenotyping of monocyte subsets, specifically, CD11clow classical monocytes. Both immune biomarkers were consistently elevated ( ≥15 pg/ml and ≥2.7 x107/L for serum IL-10 and CD11clow classical monocytes, respectively) in those patients who will subsequently die or recover after long ICU stays. This highly sensitive and specific prognostic test could prove useful in guiding clinical resource allocation."

It is caused by the activation of donor immune cells in the graft against the host shortly after transplantation, but the contributing pathogenic factors remain unclear. Here we show that human T cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1) infection of donor T cells is highly associated with aGVHD following LT. The presence of HTLV-1 in peripheral blood and tissue samples from a discovery cohort of 7 aGVHD patients and 17 control patients is assessed with hybridization probes (TargetSeq), mass cytometry (CyTOF), and multiplex immunohistology (IMC). All 7 of our aGVHD patients display detectable HTLV-1 Tax signals by IMC. We identify donor-derived cells based on a Y chromosome-specific genetic marker, EIF1AY. Thus, we confirm the presence of CD4+Tax+EIF1AY+ T cells and Tax+CD68+EIF1AY+ antigen-presenting cells, indicating HTLV-1 infection of donor immune cells. In an independent cohort of 400 patients, we verify that HTLV-1 prevalence correlates with aGVHD incidence, while none of the control viruses shows significant associations. Our findings thus provide new insights into the aetio-pathology of liver-transplantation-associated aGVHD and raise the possibility of preventing aGVHD prior to transplantation."

However, the role of SEPT5 in PCa is still unclear. In this study, we attempted to explore the expression changes, clinical relevance and immunomodulatory function of SEPT5 in PCa. Methods: The expression and clinical significance of SEPT5 were evaluated based on bioinformatic analysis and were verified by western blotting, real time PCR and IHC. Allograft mouse models were used to assess the role of SEPT5 on PCa tumour formation and immunomodulatory function. Mass cytometry and IHC were used to determine the effects of SEPT5 on immune cell infiltration, especially CD8+ T cell infiltration. Correlations between SEPT5 expression and cytokine gene expression were analyzed based on TCGA and DKFZ datasets. RNA-seq and chemokine array were performed to confirm the effects of SEPT5 on cytokine production. Results: High SEPT5 expression was found in PCa and was associated with PCa prognosis. Importantly, downregulation of SEPT5 inhibited PCa progression in vivo. In addition, SEPT5 expression was negatively correlated with immune infiltrating cell levels, chemokine and cytokine gene expression associated with CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation. Downregulation of SEPT5 increased the proportion of immune cells, especially CD8+ T cells, in tumour tissue. Both the expression of CCL5, CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10 and INFGR1 were elevated in mRNA and protein levels after SEPT5 knockdown. Conclusions: In summary, downregulation of SEPT5 inhibited PCa progression, which may be mediated by increasing immune cell infiltration levels, especially CD8+ T cells, by promoting the production of IFNG-inducible chemokines and cytokines expression associated with immune cell infiltration. Our findings suggest that SEPT5 may serve as a prognostic biomarker of PCa and may be a target molecule to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy for PCa in the future."

A complete understanding of the mechanisms by which RT induces CVD could lead to specific preventive, therapeutic approaches. It is becoming evident that both genotoxic chemotherapy agents and radiation induce mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence. Notably, one of the common phenotypes observed in cancer survivors is accelerated senescence, and immunosenescence is closely related to both cancer risk and CVD development. Therefore, suppression of immunosenescence can be an ideal target to prevent cancer treatment-induced CVD. However, the mechanism(s) by which cancer treatments induce immunosenescence are incompletely characterized. We isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) before and 3 months after RT from 16 thoracic cancer patients. We characterized human immune cell lineages and markers of senescence, DNA damage response (DDR), efferocytosis, and determinants of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminant potential (CHIP), using mass cytometry (CyTOF). We found that the frequency of the B cell subtype was decreased after RT. Unsupervised clustering of the CyTOF data identified 138 functional subsets of PBMCs. Compared with baseline, RT increased TBX21 (T-bet) expression in the largest B cell subset of Ki67-/DNMT3a+naïve B cells, and T-bet expression was correlated with phosphorylation of p90RSK expression. CD38 expression was also increased in naïve B cells (CD27-) and CD8+ effector memory CD45RA T cells (TEMRA). In vitro, we found the critical role of p90RSK activation in upregulating (1) CD38+/T-bet+ memory and naïve B, and myeloid cells, (2) senescence-associated β-gal staining, and (3) mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) after ionizing radiation (IR). These data suggest the crucial role of p90RSK activation in immunosenescence. The critical role of p90RSK activation in immune cells and T-bet induction in upregulating atherosclerosis formation has been reported. Furthermore, T-bet directly binds to the CD38 promoter region and upregulates CD38 expression. Since both T-bet and CD38 play a significant role in the process of immunosenescence, our data provide a cellular and molecular mechanism that links RT-induced p90RSK activation and the immunosenescence with T-bet and CD38 induction observed in thoracic cancer patients treated by RT and suggests that targeting the p90RSK/T-bet/CD38 pathway could play a role in preventing the radiation-associated CVD and improving cancer prognosis by inhibiting immunosenescence."

To better understand clonal evolution and mechanisms of chemoresistance, we used multiparameter mass cytometry, at single-cell resolution, to functionally characterize pediatric B-ALL cells at disease presentation and those persisting during induction therapy. Analysis of ALL cells from presentation samples (n=42) showed that the most abundant phosphosignals were pCREB, pH2AX and pHH3 and we identified JAK-STAT and RAS pathway activation in five of six patients with JAK or RAS genetic aberrations. The clonal composition of ALL was heterogeneous and dynamic during treatment but all viable cell clusters showed pCREB activation. Levels of pCREB in ALL cells were increased or maintained during therapy and high dimensional analysis revealed a subpopulation of ALL cells at presentation that was positive for pCREB/pHH3/pS6 which increased during treatment in some patients, implicating this signaling node in conferring a survival advantage to multi-agent induction therapy. The small molecule CREB inhibitor, 666-15, was shown to reduce CREB transcriptional activity and induce apoptosis in ALL patient-derived xenograft cells of varying cytogenetic subtypes in vitro, both in the presence and absence of stromal support. Together, these data suggest that the cAMP signaling pathway may provide an opportunity for minimal residual disease-directed therapy for many patients at high risk of relapse."

Changes in phenotype of myeloid cells from AD patients are more pronounced in CP and brain parenchyma and upon in vitro stimulation, suggesting that AD-myeloid cells are more vulnerable to environmental changes. Our findings underscore the importance of myeloid cells in AD and the detailed characterization across body compartments may serve as a resource for future studies focusing on the assessment of these cells as biomarkers in AD."

The composition and content of lipids in individual cells are closely related to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) which are oxidized during NK cell-mediated apoptosis. Here we investigated the changes of lipids in single HepG2 cells by label-free mass cytometry and obtained information on 53 lipids and 13 oxidized lipids after the interaction with NK92 MI cells. We found that the contents of lipids and oxidized lipids of HepG2 cells changed obviously during the NK cell-mediated apoptosis. The HepG2 cells could be classified into two phenotypes after co-culturing with NK92 MI cells based on the ratio of PC(38:6-2OH)/PC(38:6) in individual cells, which may serve as a feature to evaluate NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The present work used the lipids and oxidized lipids of individual cells to reveal the heterogeneity in NK cell-mediated apoptosis which would be a powerful method for evaluating the cytotoxicity of NK cells at the single-cell level."

Epub 2022 Dec 3.,Keywords: eosinophils; human; phenotype; thymocytes; thymus.,"Local differentiation of eosinophil precursors occurs in the human thymus. Thymic eosinophils are often positioned in the corticomedullary junction between the CD4+ CD8+ double-positive (DP) thymocytes and the CD4+ or CD8+ single-positive (SP) thymocytes. The aims of this study were to (1) determine if there are distinct thymic eosinophil populations that differ from the blood eosinophil populations and (2) evaluate the capacity of thymic eosinophils to promote the development of SP thymocytes from DP thymocytes. Thymic and blood eosinophils from thymectomized infants (n = 7) were compared regarding the expression of 34 molecules using cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF). In addition, FACS-sorted thymic eosinophils were co-cultured with autologous CD3/CD28-stimulated DP, CD4 SP, and CD8 SP thymocytes and analysed by flow cytometry and CyTOF. X-shift clustering analysis and viSNE dimensionality reduction were performed. Seven eosinophil populations were identified within the blood and thymus, respectively, five of which were specific for either tissue. Whereas the blood eosinophil populations varied between individuals, the thymic eosinophil populations were more uniform. The eosinophil-thymocyte co-cultures resulted in (1) an increase in CD4 SP thymocytes when eosinophils were cultured with DP thymocytes, (2) decreased frequency of CD8 SP thymocytes when these were cultured with eosinophils, and (3) a more mature thymic phenotype when eosinophils were cultured with CD4 SP thymocytes. Thymic eosinophils are a specialized population of eosinophils with a distinct phenotype that separates them from their blood counterparts, and in vitro they appear to favour CD4 SP thymocyte development to the detriment of CD8 SP thymocytes."

In pre-leukemia, this results in ETV6-RUNX1 antagonization of cell cycle regulation by RUNX1 as evidenced by mass cytometry analysis of B-lineage cells derived from ETV6-RUNX1 knock-in human pluripotent stem cells. In frank leukemia, knockdown of RUNX1 or its co-factor CBFβ results in cell death suggesting sustained requirement for RUNX1 activity which is recapitulated by chemical perturbation using an allosteric CBFβ-inhibitor. Strikingly, we show that RUNX1 addiction extends to other genetic subtypes of pediatric B-ALL and also adult disease. Importantly, inhibition of RUNX1 activity spares normal hematopoiesis. Our results suggest that chemical intervention in the RUNX1 program may provide a therapeutic opportunity in ALL."

In breast cancer, CD44+CD24- cells possess stem cell-like features and contribute to disease progression, and we previously described a CD44+CD24-pSTAT3+ breast cancer cell subpopulation that is dependent on JAK2/STAT3 signaling. Here we report that CD44+CD24- cells are the most frequent cell type in IBC and are commonly pSTAT3+. Combination of JAK2/STAT3 inhibition with paclitaxel decreased IBC xenograft growth more than either agent alone. IBC cell lines resistant to paclitaxel and doxorubicin were developed and characterized to mimic therapeutic resistance in patients. Multi-omic profiling of parental and resistant cells revealed enrichment of genes associated with lineage identity and inflammation in chemotherapy-resistant derivatives. Integrated pSTAT3 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses showed pSTAT3 regulates genes related to inflammation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in resistant cells, as well as PDE4A, a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase. Metabolomic characterization identified elevated cAMP signaling and CREB as a candidate therapeutic target in IBC. Investigation of cellular dynamics and heterogeneity at the single cell level during chemotherapy and acquired resistance by CyTOF and single cell RNA-seq identified mechanisms of resistance including a shift from luminal to basal/mesenchymal cell states through selection for rare preexisting subpopulations or an acquired change. Finally, combination treatment with paclitaxel and JAK2/STAT3 inhibition prevented the emergence of the mesenchymal chemo-resistant subpopulation. These results provide mechanistic rational for combination of chemotherapy with inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signaling as a more effective therapeutic strategy in IBC."

BSO potentiated the cytotoxicity of auranofin and induced lethal oxidative stress in primary pancreatic cancer cells. As assessed by the cellular thermal shift assay, auranofin engaged with thioredoxin reductase 1 in primary cells at concentrations known to induce cell death. Moreover, we used imaging mass cytometry to map the biodistribution of atomic gold in patient-derived xenografts treated with auranofin, and the drug was readily detectable throughout the epithelial and stromal compartments after treatment with a clinically relevant dose. In conclusion, combinatorial treatment with BSO and auranofin could serve as a potential therapeutic strategy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma."

Autoimmune complications are common in CLL occurring in up to a quarter of all patients during the course of the illness. Etiology of autoimmunity in CLL is unknown but it is widely admitted that the pathogenic auto-Abs do not originate from the tumoral clone but from the non-malignant B cell pool. This indicates that the developmental scheme of non-malignant B cells could also be perturbed in CLL patients. To address this question, we have designed a B cell-centered antibody panel and used time-of-flight mass cytometry to compare the residual non-malignant B cell pool of CLL patients with the peripheral B cell pool of age-matched healthy donors. We show that the non-malignant B cell compartment of the patients is characterized by profound attrition of naïve B cells and of a population of anergized autoreactive B cells, suggesting impaired B cell lymphopoeisis as well as perturbations of the B cell tolerance checkpoints."

Whether unsupervised clustering is correct is typically evaluated by agreement with dimensionality reduction techniques or based on benchmarking with manually classified cells. The ambiguity and lack of reproducibility of sequential gating has been replaced with ambiguity in interpretation of clustering results. On the other hand, spurious overclustering of data leads to loss of statistical power. We have developed INFLECT, an R-package designed to give insight in clustering results and provide an optimal number of clusters. In our approach, a mass cytometry dataset is overclustered intentionally to ensure the smallest phenotypically different subsets are captured using FlowSOM. A range of metacluster number endpoints are generated and evaluated using marker interquartile range and distribution unimodality checks. The fraction of marker distributions that pass these checks is taken as a measure of clustering success. The fraction of unimodal distributions within metaclusters is plotted against the number of generated metaclusters and reaches a plateau of diminishing returns. The inflection point at which this occurs gives an optimal point of capturing cellular heterogeneity versus statistical power."

Here, we capitalize on mass cytometry to identify high CD47 expression as a hallmark of dysfunctional MuSCs (CD47hi) with impaired regenerative capacity that predominate with aging. The prevalent CD47hi MuSC subset suppresses the residual functional CD47lo MuSC subset through a paracrine signaling loop, leading to impaired proliferation. We uncover that elevated CD47 levels on aged MuSCs result from increased U1 snRNA expression, which disrupts alternative polyadenylation. The deficit in aged MuSC function in regeneration can be overcome either by morpholino-mediated blockade of CD47 alternative polyadenylation or antibody blockade of thrombospondin-1/CD47 signaling, leading to improved regeneration in aged mice, with therapeutic implications. Our findings highlight a previously unrecognized age-dependent alteration in CD47 levels and function in MuSCs, which underlies reduced muscle repair in aging."

We developed a single-cell framework to simultaneously immuno-phenotype circulating, endovascular, and tissue-resident cells at the maternal-fetal interface throughout gestation, discriminating maternal and fetal contributions. Our data reveal distinct immune profiles across the endovascular and tissue compartments with tractable dynamics throughout gestation that respond to a systemic immune challenge in a gestationally dependent manner.

An emerging concept influencing clinical outcome involves the spatial location of CD8+ T cells, within the tumor. Our earlier work demonstrated immunosuppressive effects of NOS2 and COX2 tumor expression. Here, we show that NOS2/COX2 levels influence both the polarization and spatial location of lymphoid cells including CD8+ T cells. Importantly, elevated tumor NOS2/COX2 correlated with exclusion of CD8+ T cells from the tumor epithelium. In contrast, tumors expressing low NOS2/COX2 had increased CD8+ T cell penetration into the tumor epithelium. Consistent with a causative relationship between these observations, pharmacological inhibition of COX2 with indomethacin dramatically reduced tumor growth of the 4T1 model of TNBC in both WT and Nos2- mice. This regimen led to complete tumor regression in ∼20-25% of tumor-bearing Nos2- mice, and these animals were resistant to tumor rechallenge. Th1 cytokines were elevated in the blood of treated mice and intratumoral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were higher in mice that received indomethacin when compared to control untreated mice. Multiplex immunofluorescence imaging confirmed our phenotyping results and demonstrated that targeted Nos2/Cox2 blockade improved CD8+ T cell penetration into the 4T1 tumor core. These findings are consistent with our observations in low NOS2/COX2 expressing breast tumors proving that COX2 activity is responsible for limiting the spatial distribution of effector T cells in TNBC. Together these results suggest that clinically available NSAID's may provide a cost-effective, novel immunotherapeutic approach for treatment of aggressive tumors including triple negative breast cancer."

However, details of this dysregulation remain unclear. We performed a cross-section analysis using cytometry time-of-flight on blood samples from 12 generalized MG without glucocorticoid or other immunosuppressant treatment, and 10 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. Combining data from an external validation cohort (MG n = 38, control n = 21), bulk-RNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing, alterations in immune cell populations and differential expression of immune check point were revealed. Several switched memory B cell subsets (CD3- CD19+ CD27+ IgD- CD38+/-) were increased in MG patients. The number of HLA- DQ- CD38+ naïve B cells was higher in MG patients and correlated with the quantitative MG score (QMG). Among NK cells, the number of CD56+ CD16+ NK cells and CD56+ CD16+ CD8+ NK cells were decreased in MG patients and positively correlated with QMG. VISTA+ monocytes were increased in MG patients. Classical T cell subsets showed no significant change; however, the expression of VISTA, LAG3, CTLA4, and CXCR5 was higher in T cells from MG patients. The expression of CD38 was higher in neutrophils from MG patients. The external validation cohort validated the dysregulation of NK cell subtypes, and differences were also observed in subgroups of patients. Bulk-RNA sequencing also revealed increased mRNA expression of VSIR in monocytes of MG patients compared to those from healthy controls, and the antigen presentation and processing pathway was identified as enriched in the functional characterization of VISTA+ monocytes via single-cell RNA sequencing. Our study revealed alterations in several immune cell subsets and identified potential cellular biomarkers for MG diagnosis and disease severity assessment. In addition, the abnormal expression of multiple immune checkpoints in MG provides further rationale for the investigation of immune-checkpoint-related therapy."

Here, we sought to determine how these opposing programs are differentially induced. We demonstrated that the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) was expressed by many immune cells in the tumor in response to sustained IFN signaling. CD8+ T cell-specific deletion of IRF2 prevented acquisition of the T cell exhaustion program within the tumor and instead enabled sustained effector functions that promoted long-term tumor control and increased responsiveness to immune checkpoint and adoptive cell therapies. The long-term tumor control by IRF2-deficient CD8+ T cells required continuous integration of both IFN-I and IFN-II signals. Thus, IRF2 is a foundational feedback molecule that redirects IFN signals to suppress T cell responses and represents a potential target to enhance cancer control."

In this study, we performed RFA in a preclinical tumor-bearing KrasG12D; Trp53R172H/+; Pdx1:Cre (KPC) syngeneic model, analyzed local and abscopal affects after RFA and compared our findings with resected PDAC specimens. We found that RFA reduced PDAC tumor progression in vivo and promoted strong TME remodeling. In addition, we discovered tumor-infiltrating neutrophils determined abscopal effects. Using imaging mass cytometry, we showed that RFA elevated dendritic cell numbers in RFA-treated tumors and promoted a significant CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell abscopal response. In addition, RFA elevated levels of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and checkpoint blockade inhibition targeting PD-L1 sustained tumor growth reduction in the context of RFA. This study indicates RFA treatment, which has been shown to increase tumor antigen shedding, promotes antitumor immunity.

These maternal cells have been hypothesized to promote the maturation of the fetal immune system in utero but there are still significant gaps in our knowledge of their potential roles after birth. To provide insights into these maternal cells' postnatal functional roles, we set up a transgenic mouse model to specifically eliminate maternal cells in the neonates by diphtheria toxin injection and confirmed significant depletion in the spleens. We then performed immunophenotyping of the spleens of two-week-old pups by mass cytometry to pinpoint the immune profile differences driven by the depletion of maternal cells in early postnatal life. We observed a heightened expression of markers related to activation and maturation in some natural killer and T cell populations. We hypothesize these results to indicate a potential postnatal regulation of lymphocytic responses by maternal cells. Together, our findings highlight an immunological influence of maternal microchimeric cells postnatally, possibly protecting against adverse hypersensitivity reactions of the neonate at a crucial time of new encounters with self and environmental antigens."

In this study, we mapped psoriatic skin immune cells from paired lesional, perilesional, and nonlesional skin samples using mass cytometry. Phenotypic dendritic cells (DCs) were found in the psoriatic epidermis and dermis. Psoriatic dermal CD1c+CD11b+ cDC2s migrated to the epidermis in the perilesional skin during the preinitiation stage. CD1c+CD11b+ cDC2s rapidly replaced EpCAM+CD11clow LC cells and initiated inflammation. Simultaneously, CD207+CD11chi LC and CD5+ T cells accumulated in the psoriatic epidermis and orchestrated epidermal inflammation in psoriasis. The immune cell pool in the psoriatic dermis primarily included APCs and T cells. However, unlike that in the dermis, the epidermal immune environment was more significant and coincided with the inflammation occurring during psoriasis.The epidermal immune microenvironment plays a dominant role in psoriasis. Langerhans cells, epidermis-resident memory T cells and macrophages together contribute to healthy epidermal immune homeostasis.

We performed mass cytometry, proteomic and transcriptomic analyses to investigate peripheral blood cells and serum of HPS-1 patients. Using spatial transcriptomics, granuloma-associated signatures in the tissue of an HPS-1 patient with granulomatous colitis were dissected. In vitro studies were conducted to investigate anti-microbial responses of HPS-1 patient macrophages and cell lines. Monocytes of HPS-1 patients exhibit an inflammatory phenotype associated with dysregulated TNF, IL-1α, OSM in serum, and monocyte-derived macrophages. Inflammatory macrophages accumulate in the intestine and granuloma-associated macrophages in HPS-1 show transcriptional signatures suggestive of a lipid storage and metabolic defect. We show that HPS1 deficiency leads to an altered metabolic program and Rab32-dependent amplified mTOR signaling, facilitated by the accumulation of mTOR on lysosomes. This pathogenic mechanism translates into aberrant bacterial clearance, which can be rescued with mTORC1 inhibition. Rab32-mediated mTOR signaling acts as an immuno-metabolic checkpoint, adding to the evidence that defective bioenergetics can drive hampered anti-microbial activity and contribute to inflammation."

Based on single-cell RNA sequencing and mass cytometry, we present what we believe is the first multimodal, high-dimensional analysis to generate a comprehensive human immune atlas regarding subset composition, gene signatures, enriched pathways, and intercellular interactions of VKH patients undergoing TOFA therapy. Patients with VKH are characterized by TCs' polarization from naive to effector and memory subsets, together with accrued monocytes and upregulated cytokines and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. In vitro, TOFA reversed Th17/Treg imbalance and inhibited IL-2-induced STAT1/3 phosphorylation. TOFA alleviated VKH symptoms by restoring pathological TCs' polarization and functional marker expression and downregulating cytokine signaling and lymphocyte function. Remarkably, inflammation-related responses and intercellular interactions decreased after TOFA treatment, particularly in monocytes. Notably, we identified 2 inflammation- and JAK-associated monocyte subpopulations that were strongly implicated in VKH pathogenesis and mechanisms involved in TOFA treatment. Here, we provide a potentially novel JAK-targeted therapy for VKH and elaborate on the possible therapeutic mechanisms of TOFA, expanding our knowledge of VKH pathological patterns."

We assessed the elution capacity of dalbavancin and compared it with that of vancomycin in bone cement. Palacos®R (Heraeus Medical GmbH, Wehrheim, Germany) bone cement was manually mixed with each of the antibiotics studied at 2.5% and 5%. Three cylinders were obtained from each of the mixtures; these were weighed and incubated in 5 mL phosphate-buffered saline at 37°C under shaking for 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 24 h, 48 h, 168 h, and 336 h. PBS was replenished at each time point. The samples were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (vancomycin) and mass cytometry (dalbavancin). Elution was higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)90 for both antibiotics after 14 days of study. The release of vancomycin at 14 days was higher than of dalbavancin at each concentration tested (p = 0.05, both). However, the cumulative release of 5% dalbavancin was similar to that of 2.5% vancomycin (p = 0.513). The elution capacity of dalbavancin reached a cumulative concentration similar to that of vancomycin. Moreover, considering that the MIC90 of dalbavancin is one third that of vancomycin (0.06 mg/L and 2 mg/L, respectively) and given the long half-life of dalbavancin, it may be a new alternative for the treatment of biofilm-related periprosthetic infections when loaded in bone cement."

Transcription factor-binding motif analysis also revealed enriched IFN regulatory factors and PU.1 motifs in accessible chromatin regions. Importantly, although consecutive BNT162b2 mRNA vaccinations boosted innate immune responses and caused epigenetic changes in isolated monocytes, we show that these effects occurred only transiently and disappeared 4 weeks after the second vaccination. Furthermore, single-cell RNA-Seq analysis revealed that a similar gene signature was impaired in the monocytes of unvaccinated patients with COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome. These results reinforce the importance of the innate immune response in the determination of COVID-19 severity but indicate that, unlike adaptive immunity, innate immunity is not unexpectedly sustained even after consecutive vaccination. This study, which focuses on innate immune memory, may provide novel insights into the vaccine development against infectious diseases."

In this study, we performed cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) and revealed the distinctive immunological phenotypes of two IFNγ+ and IFNγ- Tc17 subsets that were preferentially enriched in human HCC. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis further revealed regulatory circuits governing the different phenotypes of these Tc17 subsets. In particular, we discovered that IFNγ- Tc17 subset demonstrated pro-tumoral characteristics and expressed higher levels of CCL20. This corresponded to increased tumor infiltration of T regulatory cells (Treg) validated by immunohistochemistry in another independent HCC cohort, demonstrating the immunosuppressive functions of IFNγ- Tc17 subset. Most importantly, higher intra-tumoral proportions of IFNγ- Tc17 were associated with poorer prognosis in patients with HCC and this was further validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) HCC cohort.

Phenotypic differences have been reported between PMS participants carrying small ""class I"" mutations and large ""class II"" mutations; however, the molecular perturbations underlying these divergent phenotypes remain obscure. Using peripheral blood transcriptome and serum metabolome profiling, we examined the molecular perturbations in the peripheral circulation associated with a full spectrum of PMS genotypes spanning class I (n = 37) and class II mutations (n = 39). Transcriptomic data revealed 52 genes with blood expression profiles that tightly scale with 22q.13.3 deletion size. Furthermore, we uncover 208 underexpressed genes in PMS participants with class II mutations, which were unchanged in class I mutations. These genes were not linked to 22q13.3 and were strongly enriched for glycosphingolipid metabolism, NCAM1 interactions, and cytotoxic natural killer (NK) immune cell signatures. In silico predictions estimated a reduction in CD56+ CD16- NK cell proportions in class II mutations, which was validated by mass cytometry time of flight. Global metabolomics profiling identified 24 metabolites that were significantly altered in PMS participants with class II mutations and confirmed a general reduction in sphingolipid metabolism. Collectively, these results provide new evidence linking PMS participants carrying class II mutations with decreased expression of cytotoxic cell signatures, reduced relative proportions of NK cells, and lower sphingolipid metabolism. These findings highlight alternative avenues for therapeutic development and offer new mechanistic insights supporting genotype-to-phenotype associations in PMS."

The most common and convenient mouse model is the concanavalin A (ConA) mouse model. Human menstrual-blood-derived stem cells (MenSCs) have shown great potential as a type of mesenchymal stem cell for treating various diseases. Time-of-flight mass cytometry was performed in phosphate-buffered saline control (NC) group and ConA injection with or without MenSCs treatment groups, and conventional flow cytometry was used for further validation. The serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels and H&E staining depicted that MenSCs treatment could significantly alleviate ConA-induced hepatitis. The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis of nine liver samples displayed favorable cell clustering, and the NC group was significantly different from the other two groups. The proportions of CD69+ T cells, NKT cells, and PD-L1+ macrophages were notably increased by ConA injection, while MenSCs could decrease ConA-induced macrophage percentage and M1 polarization in the liver tissue. The analysis of proinflammatory factors carried out by cytometric bead array demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-12p70, IL-6, IL-2, IL-1b, and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) were upregulated after ConA injection and then rapidly decreased at 12 h. MenSCs also played an important role in downregulating these cytokines. Here, we described the comprehensive changes in leukocytes in the liver tissue of ConA-induced hepatitis at 12 h after ConA injection and found that MenSCs rescued ConA-induced hepatitis mostly by inhibiting macrophages and M1 polarization in mouse liver."

Vision-threatening ophthalmic adverse events of COVID-19 vaccines are rare but are a matter of concern. We report a 45-year-old Japanese male with positive for HLA-DR4/HLA-DRB1*0405, who developed bilateral panuveitis resembling Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease after the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA (BNT162b2) vaccine. Glucocorticosteroid (GC) therapy combined with cyclosporine A (CsA) readily improved the panuveitis. The immune profile at the time of onset was analyzed using CyTOF technology, which revealed activations of innate immunity mainly consisting of natural killer cells, and acquired immunity predominantly composed of B cells and CD8+ T cells. On the other hand, the immune profile in the remission phase was altered by GC therapy with CsA to a profile composed primarily of CD4+ cells, which was considerably similar to that of the healthy control before the vaccination. Our results indicate that BNT162b2 vaccine may trigger an accidental immune cross-reactivity to melanocyte epitopes in the choroid, resulting in the onset of panuveitis resembling VKH disease."

However, the reliable biomarkers of post-LT HCC recurrence remain to be identified. In this study, serial peripheral blood samples from the LT recipients with and without HCC recurrence were collected at five time points. Single-cell mass cytomertry (CyTOF) was utilized for the in-depth analysis of peripheral blood monocellular cells (PBMCs). CyTOF analysis showed that at 3 weeks post-LT, the activated immune cell population was increased, while the fraction of immune cells with suppressive functions (myeloid-derived suppressive cells) was reduced. The post-LT immune composition in patients with LT for HCC was enormously different from that in patients with LT for causes other than HCC. Furthermore, at 3 weeks after LT, compared with patients without recurrence, the patients with HCC recurrences were high in two subsets of T cells: CD57+ HLA-DR+ CD8+ and CD28+γδ. The CD57+ HLA-DR+ CD8+ T cells presented high levels of perforin, granzyme B, and Ki-67 and displayed a highly cytotoxic and proliferative phenotype, while the CD28+γδ T cells had reduced levels of IFN-γ and, hence, were less activated compared to CD28- cells. Based on these findings, we concluded that analyzing the PBMCs of LT recipients by CyTOF can predict the post-LT HCC recurrence. The distinct immune features can stratify patients with the risk of HCC recurrence at 3 weeks after LT, which will help clinician in further management plan and improve the prognosis of patients."

Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) was performed to determine the association of vimentin and TSR with nCRT response in six LARC patients [three achieved pathological complete response (pCR), three did not]. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for vimentin and TSR on biopsy tissues before nCRT and logistic regression analysis were performed to further evaluate their predictive value for treatment responses in a larger patient cohort. A trend of decreased vimentin expression and increased TSR in the pCR group was revealed by IMC. In the validation group, vimentin [odds ratio (OR) 0.260, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.102-0.602, p = 0.002] and TSR (OR 4.971, 95% CI 1.933-15.431, p = 0.002) were associated with pCR by univariate analysis. Patients in the vimentin-low/TSR-low or vimentin-high/TSR-high (OR 5.211, 95% CI 1.248-35.582, p = 0.042) and vimentin-low/TSR-high groups (OR 11.846, 95% CI 3.197-77.079, p = 0.001) had significantly higher odds of pCR. By multivariate analysis, only the combination of vimentin and TSR was an independent predictor for nCRT response (OR 9.324, 95% CI 2.290-63.623, p = 0.006). Our study suggested that the combined assessment of vimentin and TSR can provide additive significance and may be a promising indicator of nCRT response in LARC patients."

While the functional states of immune cells occur along continuous phenotypic transitions, cytometric studies surveying cell phenotypes often rely on static metrics, such as discrete cell-type abundances, based on canonical markers and/or restrictive gating strategies. To overcome this limitation, we applied single-cell trajectory inference and nonnegative matrix factorization methods to CyTOF data to trace the dynamics of T cell states. In the setting of cancer immunotherapy, we showed that patient-specific summaries of continuous phenotypic shifts in T cells could be inferred from peripheral blood-derived CyTOF mass cytometry data. We further illustrated that transfer learning enabled these T cell continuous metrics to be used to estimate patient-specific cell states in new sample cohorts from a reference patient data set. Our work establishes the utility of continuous metrics for CyTOF analysis as tools for translational discovery."

While conventional tissue imaging has focused on visualizing morphological features, the development of multiplex tissue imaging from fluorescence-based methods to DNA- and mass cytometry-based methods has allowed visualization of over 60 markers on a single tissue section. The advancement of spatial biology with a single-cell resolution has enabled the visualization of cell-cell interactions and the tissue microenvironment, a crucial part to understanding the mechanisms underlying pathogenesis. Alongside the development of extensive marker panels which can distinguish distinct cell phenotypes, multiplex tissue imaging has facilitated the analysis of high dimensional data to identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets, while considering the spatial context of the cellular environment.

However, a CD56-CD16+ (CD56neg) lymphocyte population that displays NK-associated markers expands during chronic viral infections such as HIV-1 and HCV, and, to lesser extent, in herpesvirus infections. This CD56neg NK cell subset has been understudied because it requires the exclusion of other lymphocytes to accurately identify its presence. Many questions remain regarding the origin, development, phenotype, and function of the CD56neg NK cell population. Our objective was to determine the frequency of this NK subset in healthy controls and its alteration in viral infections by performing a meta-analysis. In addition to this, we analyzed deposited CyTOF and scRNAseq datasets to define the phenotype and subsets of the CD56neg NK cell population, as well as their functional variation. We found in 757 individuals, from a combined 28 studies and 6 datasets, that the CD56neg subset constitutes 5.67% of NK cells in healthy peripheral blood, while HIV-1 infection increases this population by a mean difference of 10.69%. Meta-analysis of surface marker expression between NK subsets showed no evidence of increased exhaustion or decreased proliferation within the CD56neg subset. CD56neg NK cells have a distinctive pattern of KIR expression, implying they have a unique potential for KIR-mediated education. A perforin-CD94-NKG2C-NKp30- CD56neg population exhibited different gene expression and degranulation responses against K562 cells compared to other CD56neg cells. This analysis distinguishes two functionally distinct subsets of CD56neg NK cells. They are phenotypically diverse and have differing capacity for education by HLA class-I interactions with KIRs."

Epub 2022 Oct 7.,Keywords: MXenes; biocompatibility; biomedical applications; immune system; nanomedicine.,"There is a critical unmet need to detect and image 2D materials within single cells and tissues while surveying a high degree of information from single cells. Here, a versatile multiplexed label-free single-cell detection strategy is proposed based on single-cell mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) and ion-beam imaging by time-of-flight (MIBI-TOF). This strategy, ""Label-free sINgle-cell tracKing of 2D matErials by mass cytometry and MIBI-TOF Design"" (LINKED), enables nanomaterial detection and simultaneous measurement of multiple cell and tissue features. As a proof of concept, a set of 2D materials, transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides (MXenes), is selected to ensure mass detection within the cytometry range while avoiding overlap with more than 70 currently available tags, each able to survey multiple biological parameters. First, their detection and quantification in 15 primary human immune cell subpopulations are demonstrated. Together with the detection, mass cytometry is used to capture several biological aspects of MXenes, such as their biocompatibility and cytokine production after their uptake. Through enzymatic labeling, MXenes' mediation of cell-cell interactions is simultaneously evaluated. In vivo biodistribution experiments using a mixture of MXenes in mice confirm the versatility of the detection strategy and reveal MXene accumulation in the liver, blood, spleen, lungs, and relative immune cell subtypes. Finally, MIBI-TOF is applied to detect MXenes in different organs revealing their spatial distribution. The label-free detection of 2D materials by mass cytometry at the single-cell level, on multiple cell subpopulations and in multiple organs simultaneously, will enable exciting new opportunities in biomedicine."

Despite success in animal models, candidate drugs continue to fail in clinical trials owing to the unmapped interpatient heterogeneity and disease complexity. We used a single-cell platform based on cytometry by time-of-flight (cyTOF) to precisely outline the effects of candidate drugs on human OA chondrocytes. OA chondrocytes harvested from patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty were treated with 2 drugs, an NF-κB pathway inhibitor, BMS-345541, and a chondroinductive small molecule, kartogenin, that showed preclinical success in animal models for OA. cyTOF conducted with 30 metal isotope-labeled antibodies parsed the effects of the drugs on inflammatory, senescent, and chondroprogenitor cell populations. The NF-κB pathway inhibition decreased the expression of p-NF-κB, HIF2A, and inducible NOS in multiple chondrocyte clusters and significantly depleted 4 p16ink4a-expressing senescent populations, including NOTCH1+STRO1+ chondroprogenitor cells. While kartogenin also affected select p16ink4a-expressing senescent clusters, there was a less discernible effect on chondroprogenitor cell populations. Overall, BMS-345541 elicited a uniform drug response in all patients, while only a few responded to kartogenin. These studies demonstrate that a single-cell cyTOF-based drug screening platform can provide insights into patient response assessment and patient stratification."

Although most bladder cancer patients respond well to BCG, there is no clinical parameter predictive of treatment response, and when treatment fails, the prognosis is very poor. Further, a high percentage of NMIBC patients treated with BCG suffer unwanted effects that force them to stop treatment. Thus, early identification of patients in which BCG treatment will fail is really important. Here, to identify early stage non-invasive biomarkers of non-responder patients and patients at risk of abandoning the treatment, we longitudinally analysed the phenotype of cells released into the urine of bladder cancer patients 3-7 days after BCG instillations. Mass cytometry (CyTOF) analyses revealed a large proportion of granulocytes and monocytes, mostly expressing activation markers. A novel population of CD15+CD66b+CD14+CD16+ cells was highly abundant in several samples; expression of these markers was confirmed using flow cytometry and qPCR. A stronger inflammatory response was associated with increased cell numbers in the urine; this was not due to hematuria because the cell proportions were distinct from those in the blood. This pilot study represents the first CyTOF analysis of cells recruited to urine during BCG treatment, allowing identification of informative markers associated with treatment response for sub-selection of markers to confirm using conventional techniques. Further studies should jointly evaluate cells and soluble factors in urine in larger cohorts of patients to characterise the arms of the immune response activated in responders and to identify patients at risk of complications from BCG treatment."

However, how the peripheral immune system dynamically changes along with disease progression in humans remains unclear. As a result, the minimally-invasive clinical biomarkers that can sensitively distinguish different stages of human coronary atherosclerosis are still lacking. Methods: We performed single-cell Cytometry by Time-Of-Flight (CyTOF) analyses to comprehensively profile the compositions and phenotypes of CD45+ cells derived from 83 human peripheral blood samples with two independent antibody-staining panels (T cell panel and myeloid cell panel). Clinical associations between the frequencies of peripheral immune cell subsets with AS plaque burdens of coronary arteries (Gensini score) and serum lipids were also examined. By integrating immune and clinical features, we established novel CVD risk prediction models to stratify patients in different disease stages. Results: We revealed the disease stage-associated peripheral immune features for patients with coronary atherosclerosis (CAS) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and also identified the specific peripheral immune cell subsets that were tightly associated with the disease severity of coronary arteries (Gensini score). By integrating these peripheral immune signatures with clinical features, we have established a disease progression prediction (DPP) model that could precisely discriminate CAS patients from ASCVD patients with high prediction accuracy (ROC-AUC = 0.88). Conclusion: The progression of coronary atherosclerosis is accompanied by significant alterations of the peripheral immune system, including the changes in the distributions as well as phenotypic functions of specific immune cell subsets. The indicated stage-specific peripheral immune signatures thus become promising minimally-invasive liquid biomarkers that could help to potentially diagnose and monitor the CVD progression in humans."

However, the mechanisms underlying tumour progression due to MTAP loss are yet to be elucidated. Utilizing integrated analyses of the transcriptome, proteome and secretome, we demonstrated that MTAP deficiency alters tumour-intrinsic, immune-related pathways and reprograms cytokine profiles towards a tumour-favourable environment. Additionally, MTAP-knockout cells exhibited a marked increase in the immune checkpoint protein PD-L1. Upon co-culturing primary T cells with cancer cells, MTAP loss-mediated PD-L1 upregulation inhibited T cell-mediated killing activity and induced several T cell exhaustion markers. In two xenograft tumour models, we showed a modest increase in average volume of tumours derived from MTAP-deficient cells than that of MTAP-proficient tumours. Surprisingly, a remarkable increase in tumour size was observed in humanized mice bearing MTAP-deficient tumours, as compared to their MTAP-expressing counterparts. Following immunophenotypic characterization of tumour-infiltrating leukocytes by mass cytometry analysis, MTAP-deficient tumours were found to display decreased immune infiltrates with lower proportions of both T lymphocytes and natural killer cells and higher proportions of immunosuppressive cells as compared to MTAP-expressing tumour xenografts. Taken together, our results suggest that MTAP deficiency restructures the tumour immune microenvironment, promoting tumour progression and immune evasion."

While some patients may have exceptional responses, better predictive biomarkers are needed. We profiled the circulating immune compartment of patients receiving ICI to identify possible immune markers associated with immunotherapy response or resistance. Peripheral blood samples were collected prior to, and 3 weeks after initiation of ICI. Using mass cytometry, 26 distinct immune populations were identified. Responders to immune checkpoint inhibitors had higher frequencies of naïve CD4+ T-cells, and lower frequencies of CD161+ Th17 cells and CCR4+ Th2 cells. Non-responders had a higher frequency of circulating PD1+ T-cells at baseline; there was a subsequent decrease in frequency with exposure to ICI with a concomitant increase in Ki67 expression. Flow cytometry for cytokines and chemokine receptors showed that CD4+ T cells of non-responder patients expressed less CXCR4 and CCR7. In addition, their PD1- CD4+ T cells had higher TNFα and higher CCR4 expression, while their PD1+ CD4+ T cells had higher interferon γ and lower CCR4 expression. The role of γ/δ T-cells was also explored. In responders, these cells had higher levels of interferon γ, TNFα and CCR5. One patient with a complete response had markedly higher frequency of γ/δ T-cells at baseline, and an expansion of these cells after treatment. This case was analyzed using single-cell gene expression profiling. The bulk of the γ/δ T cells consisted of a single clone of Vγ9/Vδ2 cells both before and after expansion, although the expansion was polyclonal. Gene expression analysis showed that exposure to an ICI led to a more activated phenotype of the γ/δ T cells. In this study, the circulating immune compartment was shown to have potential for biomarker discovery. Its dynamic changes during treatment may be used to assess response before radiographic changes are apparent, and these changes may help us delineate mechanisms that underpin both response and resistance to ICI. It also hypothesizes a potential role for γ/δ T cells as effector cells in some cases."

Epub 2022 Sep 28.,Keywords: Flaviviridae; RNA replicon; RNA vaccine platform; Zika congenital syndrome; Zika vaccine; Zika vector; Zika virus; arbovirus; flavivirus; microcephaly; pandemic potential.,"Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne human pathogen, causes dire congenital brain developmental abnormalities in children of infected mothers. The global health crisis precipitated by this virus has led to a concerted effort to develop effective therapies and prophylactic measures although, unfortunately, not very successfully. The error-prone nature of RNA viral genome replication tends to promote evolution of novel viral strains, which could cause epidemics and pandemics. As such, our objective was to develop a safe and effective replication-deficient ZIKV vector-based vaccine candidate. We approached this by generating a ZIKV vector containing only the nonstructural (NS) 5'-untranslated (UTR)-NS-3' UTR sequences, with the structural proteins capsid (C), precursor membrane (prM), and envelope (E) (CprME) used as a packaging system. We efficiently packaged replication-deficient Zika vaccine particles in human producer cells and verified antigen expression in vitro. In vivo studies showed that, after inoculation in neonatal mice, the Zika vaccine candidate (ZVAX) was safe and did not produce any replication-competent revertant viruses. Immunization of adult, nonpregnant mice showed that ZVAX protected mice from lethal challenge by limiting viral replication. We then evaluated the safety and efficacy of ZVAX in pregnant mice, where it was shown to provide efficient maternal and fetal protection against Zika disease. Mass cytometry analysis showed that vaccinated pregnant animals had high levels of splenic CD8+ T cells and effector memory T cell responses with reduced proinflammatory cell responses, suggesting that endogenous expression of NS proteins by ZVAX induced cellular immunity against ZIKV NS proteins. We also investigated humoral immunity against ZIKV, which is potentially induced by viral proteins present in ZVAX virions. We found no significant difference in neutralizing antibody titer in vaccinated or unvaccinated challenged animals; therefore, it is likely that cellular immunity plays a major role in ZVAX-mediated protection against ZIKV infection. In conclusion, we demonstrated ZVAX as an effective inducer of protective immunity against ZIKV, which can be further evaluated for potential prophylactic application in humans. IMPORTANCE This research is important as it strives to address the critical need for effective prophylactic measures against the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) and outlines an important vaccine technology that could potentially be used to induce immune responses against other pandemic-potential viruses."

While inflammation is a known driver of CRC, inflammatory immune infiltrates are a positive prognostic factor in CRC and predispose to response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Unfortunately, over 85% of CRC cases are primarily unresponsive to ICB due to the absence of an immune infiltrate, and even the cases that show an initial immune infiltration can become refractory to ICB. The identification of therapy supportive immune responses in the field has been partially hindered by the sparsity of suitable mouse models to recapitulate the human disease. In this study, we aimed to understand how the dysregulation of the complement anaphylatoxin C3a receptor (C3aR), observed in subsets of patients with CRC, affects the immune responses, the development of CRC, and response to ICB therapy."

In this work, we propose a boundary-seeking Clustering algorithm using the local Direction Centrality (CDC). It adopts a density-independent metric based on the distribution of K-nearest neighbors (KNNs) to distinguish between internal and boundary points. The boundary points generate enclosed cages to bind the connections of internal points, thereby preventing cross-cluster connections and separating weakly-connected clusters.

Herein we demonstrate that resting primary monocytes harbor abundant cytoplasmic ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein and that circulating exosomes contain significant ACE2 protein. Upon ex vivo TLR4/7/8 stimulation, cytoplasmic ACE2 was quickly translocated to the monocyte cell surface independently of ACE2 transcription, while TMPRSS2 surface translocation occurred in conjunction with elevated mRNA expression. The rapid translocation of ACE2 to the monocyte cell surface was blocked by the endosomal trafficking inhibitor endosidin 2, suggesting that endosomal ACE2 could be derived from circulating ACE2-containing exosomes. TLR-stimulated monocytes concurrently expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 on the cell surface were efficiently infected by SARS-CoV-2, which was significantly mitigated by remdesivir, TMPRSS2 inhibitor camostat, and anti-ACE2 antibody. Mass cytometry showed that ACE2 surface translocation in peripheral myeloid cells from patients with severe COVID-19 correlated with its hyperactivation and PD-L1 expression. Collectively, TLR4/7/8-induced ACE2 translocation with TMPRSS2 expression makes circulating monocytes permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection."

We aimed to map the immune atlas of TILs in type I EC via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), mass cytometry and flow cytometry analysis. We found that natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes were the major components of TILs in EC patients. We first identified three transcriptionally distinct NK cell subsets, which are likely to possess diverse anti-tumor functions. Additionally, CD103+ cells substantially contributed to the CD8+ T cell population. The signature gene expression of CD103+ CD8+ T cells indicated the tissue residency, immunological memory, and exhaustion properties of this cell subset, which were defined as tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM cells). Moreover, based on scRNA-seq and mass cytometry analysis, we first identified the intrinsic heterogeneity of CD103+ CD8+ T cells that were thought to have a distinct cytotoxicity, cell adhesion and exhaustion status functions. Collectively, distinct subsets of NK cells were found and might shed light on future investigations. CD103+ CD8+ T cell population may be an important immunotherapeutic target in EC and targeting this cell population with combined immunosuppressive therapy might improve the efficacy of immunotherapy for EC."

Epub 2022 Sep 8.,Keywords: CCL2; CRISPR; CyTOF; human immunodeficiency virus; latency; reservoir.,"HIV infects long-lived CD4 memory T cells, establishing a latent viral reservoir that necessitates lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART). How this reservoir is formed so quickly after infection remains unclear. We now show the innate inflammatory response to HIV infection results in CCL2 chemokine release, leading to recruitment of cells expressing the CCR2 receptor, including a subset of central memory CD4 T cells. Supporting a role for the CCL2/CCR2 axis in rapid reservoir formation, we find (i) treatment of humanized mice with anti-CCL2 antibodies during early HIV infection decreases reservoir seeding and preserves CCR2/5+ cells and (ii) CCR2/5+ cells from the blood of HIV-infected individuals on long-term ART contain significantly more integrated provirus than CCR2/5-negative memory or naive cells. Together, these studies support a model where the host's innate inflammatory response to HIV infection, including CCL2 production, leads to the recruitment of CCR2/5+ central memory CD4 T cells to zones of virus-associated inflammation, likely contributing to rapid formation of the latent HIV reservoir. IMPORTANCE There are currently over 35 million people living with HIV worldwide, and we still have no vaccine or scalable cure. One of the difficulties with HIV is its ability to rapidly establish a viral reservoir in lymphoid tissues that allows it to elude antivirals and the immune system. Thus, it is important to understand how HIV accomplishes this so we can develop preventive strategies. Our current results show that an early inflammatory response to HIV infection includes production of the chemokine CCL2, which recruits a unique subset of CCR2/5+ CD4+ T cells that become infected and form a significant reservoir for latent infection. Furthermore, we show that blockade of CCL2 in humanized mice significantly reduces persistent HIV infection. This information is relevant to the development of therapeutics to prevent and/or treat chronic HIV infections."

Previous immune profiling approaches relied on limited immune markers to establish patients' tumor immunity. However, immune cells exhibit a higher-level complexity that is typically not obtained by the conventional immunohistochemistry methods. Herein, we present a spatially variant immune infiltration score, termed as SpatialVizScore, to quantify immune cells infiltration within lung tumor samples using multiplex protein imaging data. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) was used to target 26 markers in tumors to identify stromal, immune, and cancer cell states within 26 human tissues from lung cancer patients. Unsupervised clustering methods dissected the spatial infiltration of cells in tissue using the high-dimensional analysis of 16 immune markers and other cancer and stroma enriched labels to profile alterations in the tumors' immune infiltration patterns. Spatially resolved maps of distinct tumors determined the spatial proximity and neighborhoods of immune-cancer cell pairs. These SpatialVizScore maps provided a ranking of patients' tumors consisting of immune inflamed, immune suppressed, and immune cold states, demonstrating the tumor's immune continuum assigned to three distinct infiltration score ranges. Several inflammatory and suppressive immune markers were used to establish the cell-based scoring schemes at the single-cell and pixel-level, depicting the cellular spectra in diverse lung tissues. Thus, SpatialVizScore is an emerging quantitative method to deeply study tumor immunology in cancer tissues."

These results were compared with CyTOF data generated in children who underwent transplantation with no aGVHD or age-matched healthy control participants. Onset of aGVHD was associated with the appearance of CD11b+CD163+ myeloid cells in the blood and accumulation in the skin and GI tract. Distinct T-cell populations, including TCRγδ+ cells, expressing activation markers and chemokine receptors guiding homing to the skin and GI tract were found in the same blood samples. CXCR3+ T cells released inflammation-promoting factors after overnight stimulation. These results indicate that lymphoid and myeloid compartments are triggered at aGVHD onset. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) presumably class switched, plasmablasts, and 2 distinct CD11b- dendritic cell subsets were other prominent immune populations found early during the course of aGVHD in patients refractory to both first- and second-line (MSC-based) therapy. In these nonresponding patients, effector and regulatory T cells with skin- or gut-homing receptors also remained proportionally high over time, whereas their frequencies declined in therapy responders. Our results underscore the additive value of high-dimensional immune cell profiling for clinical response evaluation, which may assist timely decision-making in the management of severe aGVHD."

Here we show it is possible to append a tellurophene to a known chemotherapeutic, teniposide, to follow this molecule in vivo. A semi-synthetic approach offers an efficient route to the teniposide analogue which is found to have similar characteristics when compared with the parent teniposide in vitro. Using mass cytometry we find the teniposide analogue has significant nonspecific binding to cells. In vivo the tellurium bearing teniposide produces the expected DNA damage in a PANC-1 xenograft model. The distribution of Te in the tissue is near the limits of detection and further work will be required to characterize the localization of this analogue with respect to cell type distributions."

Cell-of-origin (COO) classification is related to patients' prognoses. Primary drug resistance in treatment for DLBCL has been observed. The specific serum biomarkers in these patients who suffer from relapsed and refractory (R/R)-DLBCL remains unclear. In the current study, using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and mass cytometry (CyTOF), we determined and verified immune cell biomarkers at the mRNA and protein levels in single-cell resolution from 18 diagnostic PBMC specimens collected from patients with R/R DLBCL. As controls, 5 PBMC specimens from healthy volunteers were obtained. We identified a panel of 35 surface marker genes for the features of R/R DLBCL unique cell cluster by scRNA-seq of 8 R/R DLBCL patient samples and validated its efficiency in an external cohort consisting of 10 R/R DLBCL patients by CyTOF. The cell clustering and dimension reduction were compared among R/R DLBCL samples in CyTOF Space with COO as well as the C-MYC expression designation. Immune cells from each patient occupied unique regions in the 32-dimensional phenotypic space with no apparent clustering of samples into discrete subtypes. Significant heterogeneity observed in subgroups was mainly attributed to individual differences among samples and not to expression differences in a single, homogeneous immune cell subpopulation. The marker panel showed reliability in labeling R/R DLBCL without any influence from COO stratification and C-MYC expression designation. Furthermore, we compared all the markers between R/R DLBCL and normal samples. A total of 12 biomarkers were significantly overexpressed in R/R DLBCL relative to the normal samples. Therefore, we further optimized the diagnostic biomarker panel of R/R DLBCL comprising CD82, CD55, CD36, CD63, CD59, IKZF1, CD69, CD163, CD14, CD226, CD84, and CD31. In summary, we developed a novel set of biomarkers for the diagnoses of patients with R/R DLBCL. Detections procedures at single-cell resolution provide precise biomarkers, which may substantially overcome intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity among primary samples. The findings confirmed that each case was unique and may comprise multiple, genetically distinct subclones."

The introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically improved life expectancy in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals by suppressing viral replication and increasing CD4+ T-cell counts. Immunosenescence-like changes, including the expansion of memory CD8+ T cells with senescent features, are reported in young HIV-infected individuals who do not have clinically detectable viremia on ART. However, it is less known whether HIV infection affects the immunosenescent status in older HIV-infected individuals. Here, we addressed this question in older HIV-infected, HIV-uninfected, and frail individuals (all groups age ≥65 years) by examining a set of aging-associated genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as well as by analyzing subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in depth using high-dimensional CyTOF analysis. Older HIV-infected individuals had increased expression of aging-associated genes such as CX3CR1 in PBMCs which are related to IL-7 receptor low effector memory (IL-7Rαlow EM) CD8+ T cells, a cell population known to expand with age. The subsets of IL-7Rαlow EM CD8+ T cells expressing senescent, cytotoxic, and inflammatory molecules, including CD57, perforin, and CX3CR1, as well as memory CD4+ T cells expressing CD161 and CXCR3, molecules associated with replication-competent HIV-1 harboring cells, were increased in older HIV-infected individuals. Overall, older HIV-infected individuals without detectable viremia on ART had augmented levels of age-associated immune alterations in PBMCs, suggesting that HIV infection has a persistent impact on senescence in older HIV-infected individuals despite the clinically controlled viremia."

Dimensionality reduction captures the structure and heterogeneity of the original dataset, creating low-dimensional visualizations that contribute to the human understanding of data. Existing algorithms are typically unsupervised, using measured features to generate manifolds, disregarding known biological labels such as cell type or experimental time point. We repurpose the classification algorithm, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), for supervised dimensionality reduction of single-cell data. LDA identifies linear combinations of predictors that optimally separate a priori classes, enabling the study of specific aspects of cellular heterogeneity. We implement feature selection by hybrid subset selection (HSS) and demonstrate that this computationally efficient approach generates non-stochastic, interpretable axes amenable to diverse biological processes such as differentiation over time and cell cycle. We benchmark HSS-LDA against several popular dimensionality-reduction algorithms and illustrate its utility and versatility for the exploration of single-cell mass cytometry, transcriptomics, and chromatin accessibility data."

The expression of tk in transduced cancer cells results in conversion of the pro-drug ganciclovir into a toxic metabolite causing DNA damage, inducing immunogenic cell death and immune activation. We hypothesize that CAN-2409 combined with DNA-damage-response inhibitors could amplify tumor cell death, resulting in an improved response. We investigated the effects of ATR inhibitor AZD6738 in combination with CAN-2409 in vitro using cytotoxicity, cytokine, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) assays in glioma cell lines and in vivo with an orthotopic syngeneic murine glioma model. Tumor immune infiltrates were analyzed by cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF). In vitro, we observed a significant increase in the DNA-damage marker γH2AX and decreased expression of PD-L1, pro-tumorigenic cytokines (interleukin-1β [IL-1β], IL-4), and ligand NKG2D after combination treatment compared with monotherapy or control. In vivo, long-term survival was increased after combination treatment (66.7%) compared with CAN-2409 (50%) and control. In a tumor re-challenge, long-term immunity after combination treatment was not improved. Our results suggest that ATR inhibition could amplify CAN-2409's efficacy in glioblastoma through increased DNA damage while having complex immunological ramifications, warranting further studies to determine the ideal conditions for maximized therapeutic benefit."

Yet, information regarding its cargo and its association with HIV rapid progressors (RPs) and typical progressors (TPs) remain largely unknown. In this study, exosomal miRNAs sequencing and mass cytometry were used to identify differential exosomal miRNAs and membrane proteins that participate in the pathogenesis of TPs and RPs. We discovered that miR-144-5p, miR-1180-3p, miR-451a, miR-362-5p, and miR-625-5p are associated with the TPs and miR-362-5p with the RPs. Decreased autophagy, amino acid metabolism, immune response, and IL-6 are closely related to RPs. In addition, SP1 was selected as the most significant transcription factor (TF) associated with disease progression. CD49D, CD5, CCR5, CD40, CD14, and CD86 were selected as the differential exosomal membrane proteins between TPs and RPs. This study provides valuable information for clarifying the mechanism in people with acute HIV infection."

Epub 2022 Aug 27.,Keywords: Biomonitoring; Elemental bioimaging; Elemental speciation analysis; Inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry; Isotope ratios; LA-ICP-MS; LC-ICP-MS.,"Since its inception in the early 80s, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry has developed to the method of choice for the analysis of elements in complex biological systems. High sensitivity paired with isotopic selectivity and a vast dynamic range endorsed ICP-MS for the inquiry of metals in the context of biomedical questions. In a stand-alone configuration, it has optimal qualities for the biomonitoring of major, trace and toxicologically relevant elements and may further be employed for the characterisation of disrupted metabolic pathways in the context of diverse pathologies. The on-line coupling to laser ablation (LA) and chromatography expanded the scope and application range of ICP-MS and set benchmarks for accurate and quantitative speciation analysis and element bioimaging. Furthermore, isotopic analysis provided new avenues to reveal an altered metabolism, for the application of tracers and for calibration approaches. In the last two decades, the scope of ICP-MS was further expanded and inspired by the introduction of new instrumentation and methodologies including novel and improved hardware as well as immunochemical methods. These additions caused a paradigm shift for the biomedical application of ICP-MS and its impact in the medical sciences and enabled the analysis of individual cells, their microenvironment, nanomaterials considered for medical applications, analysis of biomolecules and the design of novel bioassays. These new facets are gradually recognised in the medical communities and several clinical trials are underway. Altogether, ICP-MS emerged as an extremely versatile technique with a vast potential to provide novel insights and complementary perspectives and to push the limits in the medical disciplines. This review will introduce the different facets of ICP-MS and will be divided into two parts. The first part will cover instrumental basics, technological advances, and fundamental considerations as well as traditional and current applications of ICP-MS and its hyphenated techniques in the context of biomonitoring, bioimaging and elemental speciation. The second part will build on this fundament and describe more recent directions with an emphasis on nanomedicine, immunochemistry, mass cytometry and novel bioassays."

We assessed the uptake, distribution, and NO detection capacity of an irreversible, ruthenium-based, fluorescent NO sensor (Ru-NO) in macrophages, plasma, and atherosclerotic plaques. In vitro, incubation of Ru-NO with human THP1 monocytes and THP1-PMA macrophages caused robust uptake, detected by Ru-NO fluorescence using mass-cytometry, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry. THP1-PMA macrophages had higher Ru-NO uptake (+13%, p < 0.05) than THP1 monocytes with increased Ru-NO fluorescence following lipopolysaccharide stimulation (+14%, p < 0.05). In mice, intraperitoneal infusion of Ru-NO found Ru-NO uptake was greater in peritoneal CD11b+F4/80+ macrophages (+61%, p < 0.01) than CD11b+F4/80− monocytes. Infusion of Ru-NO into Apoe−/− mice fed high-cholesterol diet (HCD) revealed Ru-NO fluorescence co-localised with atherosclerotic plaque macrophages. When Ru-NO was added ex vivo to aortic cell suspensions from Apoe−/− mice, macrophage-specific uptake of Ru-NO was demonstrated. Ru-NO was added ex vivo to tail-vein blood samples collected monthly from Apoe−/− mice on HCD or chow. The plasma Ru-NO fluorescence signal was higher in HCD than chow-fed mice after 12 weeks (37.9%, p < 0.05). Finally, Ru-NO was added to plasma from patients (N = 50) following clinically-indicated angiograms. There was lower Ru-NO fluorescence from plasma from patients with myocardial infarction (−30.7%, p < 0.01) than those with stable coronary atherosclerosis. In conclusion, Ru-NO is internalised by macrophages in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo, can be detected in atherosclerotic plaques, and generates measurable changes in fluorescence in murine and human plasma. Ru-NO displays promising utility as a sensor of atherosclerosis."

However, it is unclear which ICPs are associated with the clinical phenotypes of SLE. We analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 28 SLE patients using mass cytometry and identified 30 ICPs. We determined the proliferative activity of ICPs by measuring the proportion of cells expressing specific markers and Ki-67 among CD45+ cells (Ki-67+ proportion). We observed an increased Ki-67+ proportion for many ICPs of SLE patients and examined the association between their Ki-67+ proportions and clinical findings. The Ki-67+ proportions of five ICPs [classical monocyte (cMo), effector memory CD8+ T cell (CD8Tem), CXCR5- naive B cell (CXCR5- nB), and CXCR5- IgD-CD27- B cell (CXCR5- DNB)] were identified as clinically important factors. The SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) was positively correlated with cMo and plasma cells (PC). The titer of anti-DNA antibodies was positively correlated with cMo, CXCR5- nB, and CXCR5- DNB. The C4 level was negatively correlated with CXCR5- DNB. The bioactivity of type I interferon was also positively correlated with these ICPs. Fever and renal involvement were associated with cMo. Rash was associated with CD8Tem and CXCR5- DNB. On the basis of the proliferative activity among five ICPs, SLE patients can be classified into five clusters showing different SLE phenotypes. Evaluation of the proliferative activity in each ICP can be linked to the clinical phenotypes of individual SLE patients and help in the treatment strategy."

Epub 2022 Aug 18.,Keywords: Mass cytometry; Multiomics; Single cell; Solid organ transplantation; Transplant immunology.,"Solid organ transplantation (SOT) is the standard of care for end-stage organ disease. The most frequent complication of SOT involves allograft rejection, which may occur via T cell- and/or antibody-mediated mechanisms. Diagnosis of rejection in the clinical setting requires an invasive biopsy as there are currently no reliable biomarkers to detect rejection episodes. Likewise, it is virtually impossible to identify patients who exhibit operational tolerance and may be candidates for reduced or complete withdrawal of immunosuppression. Emerging single-cell technologies, including cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF), imaging mass cytometry, and single-cell RNA sequencing, represent a new opportunity for deep characterization of pathogenic immune populations involved in both allograft rejection and tolerance in clinical samples. These techniques enable examination of both individual cellular phenotypes and cell-to-cell interactions, ultimately providing new insights into the complex pathophysiology of allograft rejection. However, working with these large, highly dimensional datasets requires expertise in advanced data processing and analysis using computational biology techniques. Machine learning algorithms represent an optimal strategy to analyze and create predictive models using these complex datasets and will likely be essential for future clinical application of patient level results based on single-cell data. Herein, we review the existing literature on single-cell techniques in the context of SOT."

Tumor-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) containing exosomes are emerging contributors to tumor progression and immunomodulation. However, a comprehensive definition of how tumor-derived sEVs impacts systemic immunity is lacking. In this study, we used mass cytometry with extensive antibody panels to determine the expression of 24 immune cell markers, eight intracellular proteins, and seven immune checkpoint proteins in systemic immune cell lineages. The systemic immune landscape in response to tumor-derived sEVs across three immune organs in a melanoma mouse model was then characterized. Melanoma-derived sEVs significantly and extensively influenced the composition and intracellular pathways of immune lineage and T cells. An immunosuppressive immune system with decreased natural killer and CD8 T cells in the spleen and bone marrow (BM), increased regulatory T cells in lymph nodes, and increased polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSC) in the BM, was induced by melanoma-derived sEVs. Additionally, melanoma-derived sEVs significantly enhanced the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in CD4 T cells and myeloid cell subsets. These sEVs largely promoted the proliferation of multiple hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell subsets and accelerated their differentiation towards MDSCs in naive mice and mice undergoing hematopoietic reconstruction. Moreover, melanoma-derived sEVs directly promoted the survival and activation of MDSCs in vitro. Collectively, our work examines the effects of tumor-derived sEVs on the systemic onco-immune macroenvironments and highlights the contribution of these sEVs to the dysregulation of hematopoiesis and systemic immune landscape in cancer."

Using mass cytometry (CyTOF) to analyze the immune cell composition in the lamina propria (LP) of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), we observed an enrichment of CD4+ effector T cells producing IL-17A and TNF, CD8+ T cells producing IFNγ, T regulatory (Treg) cells, and innate lymphoid cells (ILC). The function of these immune cells is regulated by store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), which results from the opening of Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels formed by ORAI and STIM proteins. We observed that the pharmacologic inhibition of SOCE attenuated the production of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-17A, TNF, and IFNγ by human colonic T cells and ILCs, reduced the production of IL-6 by B cells and the production of IFNγ by myeloid cells, but had no effect on the viability, differentiation, and function of intestinal epithelial cells. T cell-specific deletion of CRAC channel genes in mice showed that Orai1, Stim1, and Stim2-deficient T cells have quantitatively distinct defects in SOCE, which correlate with gradually more pronounced impairment of cytokine production by Th1 and Th17 cells and the severity of IBD. Moreover, the pharmacologic inhibition of SOCE with a selective CRAC channel inhibitor attenuated IBD severity and colitogenic T cell function in mice. Our data indicate that SOCE inhibition may be a suitable new approach for the treatment of IBD."

Epub 2022 Aug 1.,Keywords: CFI-402257; STING pathway; TTK inhibitor; cytosolic DNA sensing; senescence.,"Deregulation of cell cycle is a typical feature of cancer cells. Normal cells rely on the strictly coordinated spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) to maintain the genome integrity and survive. However, cancer cells could bypass this checkpoint mechanism. In this study, we showed the clinical relevance of threonine tyrosine kinase (TTK) protein kinase, a central regulator of the SAC, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its potential as therapeutic target. Here, we reported that a newly developed, orally active small molecule inhibitor targeting TTK (CFI-402257) effectively suppressed HCC growth and induced highly aneuploid HCC cells, DNA damage, and micronuclei formation. We identified that CFI-402257 also induced cytosolic DNA, senescence-like response, and activated DDX41-STING cytosolic DNA sensing pathway to produce senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASPs) in HCC cells. These SASPs subsequently led to recruitment of different subsets of immune cells (natural killer cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells) for tumor clearance. Our mass cytometry data illustrated the dynamic changes in the tumor-infiltrating immune populations after treatment with CFI-402257. Further, CFI-402257 improved survival in HCC-bearing mice treated with anti-PD-1, suggesting the possibility of combination treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors in HCC patients. In summary, our study characterized CFI-402257 as a potential therapeutic for HCC, both used as a single agent and in combination therapy."

Epidemiological studies have revealed the increased incidence of prostate and thyroid cancer in WTC survivors and responders. While reports have shown that WTC-dust associates with the increased prevalence of inflammatory related disorders, studies to date have not determined whether this exposure impacts cancer progression. In this study, we have used genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models with prostate specific deletion of the PTEN tumor suppressor to study the impact of WTC-dust exposure on deposition of dust particles, inflammation, and cancer progression. In normal C57/BL6 mice, dust exposure increased cellular expression of inflammatory genes with highest levels in the lung and peripheral blood. In normal and tumor bearing GEM mice, increased immune cell infiltration to the lungs was observed. Pathological evaluation of mice at different time points showed that WTC-dust exposure promoted PI3K-AKT activation, increased epithelial proliferation and acinar invasion in prostates with heterozygous and homozygous Pten loss. Using autochthonous and transplant GEM models of prostate cancer we demonstrated that dust exposure caused reduced survival as compared to control cohorts. Finally, we used imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to detect elevated immune cell infiltration and cellular expression of inflammatory markers in prostate tumors isolated from human WTC survivors. Collectively, our study shows that chronic inflammation, induced by WTC dust exposure, promotes more aggressive cancer in genetically predisposed prostates and potentially in patients."

However, the mechanism of CIP remains unclear and no evidence-based treatment except for glucocorticoids is available. Herein, we report the case of a patient with metastatic bladder cancer who received tislelizumab and was diagnosed with CIP. The patient underwent transbronchial cryobiopsy. The patient was treated with glucocorticoid, but CIP recurred when the glucocorticoid tapering. The paraffine-embedded lung tissue was sectioned, stained with 31 heavy-metal tagged antibodies, and analyzed using imaging mass cytometry (IMC) technology. We identified multiple immune cell subsets in the lung tissue and observed the infiltration of memory T cells and the CD4+ DC subset. The data indicated the great potential of IMC technology in the identification and characterization of irAEs. Further investigation is warranted to identify the mechanism of action of CIP."

Imaging mass cytometry enables high dimensional imaging of tissue while preserving spatial context and is therefore a suitable tool to unravel spatial relationships between cells. As availability of human tissue collected over the course of disease or infection is limited, preclinical models are a valuable source of such material. Non-human primate models are used for translational research as their anatomy, physiology and immune system closely resemble those of humans due to close evolutionary proximity. Tissue from non-human primate studies is often preserved large archives encompassing a range of conditions and organs. However, knowledge on antibody clones suitable for FFPE tissue of non-human primate origin is very limited. Here, we present an imaging mass cytometry panel development pipeline which enables the selection and incorporation of antibodies for imaging of non-human primate tissue. This has resulted in an 18-marker backbone panel which enables visualization of a broad range of leukocyte subsets in rhesus and cynomolgus macaque tissues. This high-dimensional imaging mass cytometry panel can be used to increase our knowledge of cellular organization within tissues and its effect on outcome of disease."

We investigated regulatory and pro-inflammatory cytokine-expressing B cells in patients with melanoma by flow cytometric intracellular cytokine, CyTOF, transcriptomic, immunofluorescence, single-cell RNA-seq, and B:T cell co-culture analyses. We found enhanced circulating regulatory (TGF-β+ and PD-L1+) and reduced pro-inflammatory TNF-α+ B cell populations in patients compared with healthy volunteers (HVs), including lower IFN-γ+:IL-4+ and higher TGF-β+:TNF-α+ B cell ratios in patients. TGF-β-expressing B cells in the melanoma tumor microenvironment assembled in clusters and interacted with T cells via lymphoid recruitment (SELL, CXCL13, CCL4, CD74) signals and with Tregs via CD47:SIRP-γ, and FOXP3-promoting Galectin-9:CD44. While reduced in tumors compared to blood, TNF-α-expressing B cells engaged in crosstalk with Tregs via TNF-α signaling and the ICOS/ICOSL axis. Patient-derived B cells promoted FOXP3+ Treg differentiation in a TGF-β-dependent manner, while sustaining expression of IFN-γ and TNF-α by autologous T-helper cells and promoting T-helper cell proliferation ex vivo, an effect further enhanced with anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade. Our findings reveal cytokine-expressing B cell compartments skewed toward regulatory phenotypes in patient circulation and melanoma lesions, intratumor spatial localization, and bidirectional crosstalk between B and T cell subsets with immunosuppressive attributes."

Both forms present with a chronic inflammation of the (gastro) intestinal tract, which induces excessive changes in the composition of the associated extracellular matrix (ECM). In UC, the inflammation is limited to the colon, whereas it can occur throughout the entire gastrointestinal tract in CD. Tools for early diagnosis of IBD are still very limited and highly invasive and measures for standardized evaluation of structural changes are scarce. To investigate an efficient non-invasive way of diagnosing intestinal inflammation and early changes of the ECM, very small superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (VSOPs) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were applied in two mouse models of experimental colitis: the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and the transfer model of colitis. For further validation of ECM changes and inflammation, tissue sections were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. For in depth ex-vivo investigation of VSOPs localization within the tissue, Europium-doped VSOPs served to visualize the contrast agent by imaging mass cytometry (IMC). VSOPs accumulation in the inflamed colon wall of DSS-induced colitis mice was visualized in T2* weighted MRI scans. Components of the ECM, especially the hyaluronic acid content, were found to influence VSOPs binding. Using IMC, co-localization of VSOPs with macrophages and endothelial cells in colon tissue was shown. In contrast to the DSS model, colonic inflammation could not be visualized with VSOP-enhanced MRI in transfer colitis. VSOPs present a potential contrast agent for contrast-enhanced MRI to detect intestinal inflammation in mice at an early stage and in a less invasive manner depending on hyaluronic acid content."

Previous work demonstrated that the effects of oncogenic NRAS in mediating proliferation and self-renewal are mutually exclusive within leukemia subpopulations and that levels of oncogenic NRAS vary between highly proliferative and self-renewing leukemia subpopulations. These findings suggest that NRAS activity levels may be important determinants of leukemic behavior. To define how oncogenic NRAS levels affect these functions, we genetically engineered an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line, THP-1, to express variable levels of NRASG12V. We replaced the endogenous NRASG12D gene with a tetracycline-inducible and dose-responsive NRASG12V transgene. Cells lacking NRASG12V oncoprotein were cell-cycle arrested. Intermediate levels of NRASG12V induced maximal proliferation; higher levels led to attenuated proliferation, increased G1 arrest, senescence markers, and maximal self-renewal capacity. Higher levels of the oncoprotein also induced self-renewal and mitochondrial genes. We used mass cytometry (CyTOF) to define the downstream signaling events that mediate these differential effects. Not surprisingly, we found that the levels of such canonical RAS-effectors as pERK and p4EBP1 correlated with NRASG12V levels. β-Catenin, a mediator of self-renewal, also correlated with NRASG12V levels. These signaling intermediates may mediate the differential effects of NRASG12V in leukemia biology. Together, these data reveal that oncogenic NRAS levels are important determinants of leukemic behavior explaining heterogeneity in phenotypes within a clone. This system provides a new model to study RAS oncogene addiction and RAS-induced self-renewal in AML."

Despite its wide clinical use, the mechanisms underlying clinical response are not understood. This study aimed to reveal immune markers of therapeutic response to DMF treatment in MS. For this purpose, we prospectively collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a highly characterized cohort of 44 individuals with MS before and at 12 and 48 wk of DMF treatment. Single cells were profiled using high-dimensional mass cytometry. To capture the heterogeneity of different immune subsets, we adopted a bioinformatic multipanel approach that allowed cell population-cluster assignment of more than 50 different parameters, including lineage and activation markers as well as chemokine receptors and cytokines. Data were further analyzed in a semiunbiased fashion implementing a supervised representation learning approach to capture subtle longitudinal immune changes characteristic for therapy response. With this approach, we identified a population of memory T helper cells expressing high levels of neuroinflammatory cytokines (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], interferon γ [IFNγ]) as well as CXCR3, whose abundance correlated with treatment response. Using spectral flow cytometry, we confirmed these findings in a second cohort of patients. Serum neurofilament light-chain levels confirmed the correlation of this immune cell signature with axonal damage. The identified cell population is expanded in peripheral blood under natalizumab treatment, substantiating a specific role in treatment response. We propose that depletion of GM-CSF-, IFNγ-, and CXCR3-expressing T helper cells is the main mechanism of action of DMF and allows monitoring of treatment response."

However, how the composition of the immune landscape affects the tumor progression of gastric cancer (GC) is ill-defined. Here, we used mass cytometry to perform simultaneous in-depth immune profiling of the tumor, adjacent tissues, and blood cells from GC patients and revealed a unique GC tumor-immune signature, where CD8+ T cells were present at a lower frequency in tumor tissues compared to adjacent tissues, whereas regulatory T cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were significantly increased, indicating strong suppressive TIME in GC. Incorporated with oncogenic genomic traits, we found that the unique immunophenotype was interactively shaped by a specific GC gene signature across tumor progression. Earlier-stage GC lesions with IFN signaling enrichment harbored significantly altered T-cell compartments while advanced GC featured by metabolism signaling activation was accumulated by TAMs. Interestingly, PD-1 expression on CD8+ T cells was relatively higher in earlier-stage GC patients, indicating that these patients may derive more benefits from PD-1 inhibitors. The dynamic properties of diverse immune cell types revealed by our study provide new dimensions to the immune landscape of GC and facilitate the development of novel immunotherapy strategies for GC patients."

However, primary and secondary resistance to CAR-T cell therapy is commonly encountered in various clinical trials. Despite the comprehensive studies to elucidate the mechanisms of resistance, effective resolution in clinical practice is still elusive. Inadequate persistence and subsequent loss of infused CAR-T cells are proposed major resistance mechanism associated with CAR-T cell treatment failure. Thus, we generated CAR-T cells armored with IL-7 to prolong the persistence of infused T-cells, particularly CD4 + T cells, and enhanced anti-tumor response. IL-7 increased CAR-T-cell persistence in vivo and contributed to the distinct T-cell cytotoxicity profile. Using mass cytometry (CyTOF), we further assessed the phenotypic and metabolic profiles of IL-7-secreting CAR-T cells, along with conventional CAR-T cells at the single-cell level. With in-depth analysis, we found that IL-7 maintained CAR-T cells in a less differentiated T-cell state, regulated distinct metabolic activity, and prevented CAR-T-cell exhaustion, which could be essential for CAR-T cells to maintain their metabolic fitness and anti-tumor response. Our findings thus provided clinical rationale to exploit IL-7 signaling for modulation and metabolic reprogramming of T-cell function to enhance CAR-T cell persistence and induce durable remission upon CAR-T cell therapy."

Fluorescent cell barcoding has been established as a standard method for multiplexing in flow cytometry analysis. In parallel, mass-tag barcoding is routinely used to label cells for mass cytometry. Barcode reagents currently used label intracellular proteins in fixed and permeabilized cells and, therefore, are not suitable for studies with live cells in long-term culture prior to analysis. In this study, we report the development of fluorescent palladium-based hybrid-tag nanotrackers to barcode live cells for flow and mass cytometry dual-modal readout. We describe the preparation, physicochemical characterization, efficiency of cell internalization, and durability of these nanotrackers in live cells cultured over time. In addition, we demonstrate their compatibility with standardized cytometry reagents and protocols. Finally, we validated these nanotrackers for drug response assays during a long-term coculture experiment with two barcoded cell lines. This method represents a new and widely applicable advance for fluorescent and mass-tag barcoding that is independent of protein expression levels and can be used to label cells before long-term drug studies."

Many patients also develop long-COVID-19, experiencing symptoms months after infection. Although significant progress has been made in understanding the immune response to acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, gaps remain in our knowledge of how innate immunity influences disease kinetics and severity. We hypothesized that cytometry by time-of-flight analysis of PBMCs from healthy and infected subjects would identify novel cell surface markers and innate immune cell subsets associated with COVID-19 severity. In this pursuit, we identified monocyte and dendritic cell subsets that changed in frequency during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and correlated with clinical parameters of disease severity. Subsets of nonclassical monocytes decreased in frequency in hospitalized subjects, yet increased in the most severe patients and positively correlated with clinical values associated with worse disease severity. CD9, CD163, PDL1, and PDL2 expression significantly increased in hospitalized subjects, and CD9 and 6-Sulfo LacNac emerged as the markers that best distinguished monocyte subsets amongst all subjects. CD9+ monocytes remained elevated, whereas nonclassical monocytes remained decreased, in the blood of hospitalized subjects at 3-4 months postinfection. Finally, we found that CD9+ monocytes functionally released more IL-8 and MCP-1 after LPS stimulation. This study identifies new monocyte subsets present in the blood of COVID-19 patients that correlate with disease severity, and links CD9+ monocytes to COVID-19 progression."

However, the mechanistic bases of these tumor outcomes are incompletely understood and even less is known about the potential role played by the non-malignant cellular constituents of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we revealed an inverse correlation between TAZ expression and survival in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), but not other subtypes of breast cancer. We found that TAZ knockdown in two murine TNBC tumor cell line models significantly inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in immune competent but not immune deficient hosts. RNA-seq analyses identified substantial alterations in immune components in TAZ knockdown tumors. Using mass cytometry analysis, we found that TAZ-deficiency altered the immune landscape of the TME leading to significant reductions in immune suppressive populations, namely myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and macrophages accompanied by elevated CD8+ T cell/myeloid cell ratios. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that TAZ-mediated tumor growth was MDSC-dependent in that MDSC depletion led to reduced tumor growth in control, but not TAZ-knockdown tumor cells. Altogether, we identified a novel non-cancer cell-autonomous mechanism by which tumor-intrinsic TAZ expression aids tumor progression. Thus, our findings advance an understanding of the crosstalk between tumor-derived TAZ expression and the immune contexture within the TME, which may lead to new therapeutic interventions for TNBC or other TAZ-driven cancers."

Analyzing peripheral blood cells from multiple cancer types revealed that differential responsiveness to IFN-Is before anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) treatment was highly predictive of long-term survival after therapy. Unexpectedly, IFN-I hyporesponsiveness efficiently predicted long-term survival, whereas high responsiveness to IFN-I was strongly associated with treatment failure and diminished survival time. Peripheral IFN-I responsive states were not associated with tumor inflammation, identifying a disconnect between systemic immune potential and 'cold' or 'hot' tumor states. Mechanistically, IFN-I responsiveness was epigenetically imprinted before therapy, poising cells for differential inflammatory responses and dysfunctional T cell effector programs. Thus, we identify physiological cell states with clinical importance that can predict success and long-term survival of PD1-blocking immunotherapy."

Two important populations of NK cells with differing functions are recognized: CD56bright and CD56dim. NK cells have the potential to recognize and kill malignant plasma cells, which offers therapeutic opportunities. We used mass cytometry to examine the phenotype and function of NK cell subsets from patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM). We show that NK cells in NDMM are shifted toward a CD56bright but dysfunctional cytotoxic phenotype, which exhibits selective loss of cytokine production. The CD56dim subset has features of exhaustion with impaired proliferation, upregulation of programmed cell death protein 1, and loss of T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 expression. Poor expression of NK cell activation markers is seen and is associated with inferior long-term survival. These results suggest that NK cell exhaustion is already present by the time of myeloma diagnosis and likely contributes to the loss of immunologic control of malignant plasma cells. Restoring NK cell function via immune-directed therapies offers a route to restoring immunologic control in multiple myeloma."

Methods: We employed deep learning to profile the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) samples from TCGA datasets and noticed that fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling pathways were enriched in the immune-excluded phenotype of TNBC. Erdafitinib, a selective FGFR inhibitor, was then used to investigate the effect of FGFR blockade on TIME landscape of TNBC syngeneic mouse models by flow cytometry, mass cytometry (CyTOF) and RNA sequencing. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and transwell migration assay were carried out to detect the effect of FGFR blockade on cell proliferation and migration, respectively. Cytokine array, western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence (IF) were employed to investigate the potential mechanism by which FGFR inhibition enhanced T cell infiltration. Results: Blocking FGFR pathway by Erdafitinib markedly suppressed tumor growth with increased T cell infiltration in immunocompetent mouse models of TNBC. Mechanistically, FGFR blockade inhibited cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) proliferation, migration and secretion of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) by down-regulating MAPK/ERK pathway in CAFs, thus promoting T cell infiltration by breaking physical and chemical barriers built by CAFs in TIME. Furthermore, we observed that FGFR inhibition combined with immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICT) greatly improved the therapeutic response of TNBC tumor models. Conclusions: FGFR blockade enhanced ICT response by turning immune ""cold"" tumor into ""hot"" tumor, providing remarkable implications of FGFR inhibitors as adjuvant agents for combinatorial immunotherapy."

In various malignancies, several immunoregulatory mechanisms have been shown to restrain antitumor immunity, including ligand-mediated engagement of inhibitory receptors (IRs) on effector cells, and induction of immunosuppressive cell subsets, such as regulatory T cells (Tregs) or myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Relapse after HSCT remains a major therapeutic challenge, but immunoregulatory mechanisms involved in restraining the GVL effect must be better deciphered in humans. We used mass cytometry to comprehensively characterize circulating leukocytes in 2 cohorts of patients after allo-HSCT. We first longitudinally assessed various immunoregulatory parameters highlighting specific trends, such as opposite dynamics between MDSCs and Tregs. More generally, the immune landscape was stable from months 3 to 6, whereas many variations occurred from months 6 to 12 after HSCT. Comparison with healthy individuals revealed that profound alterations in the immune equilibrium persisted 1 year after HSCT. Importantly, we found that high levels of TIGIT and CD161 expression on CD4 T cells at month 3 after HSCT were distinct features significantly associated with subsequent AML relapse in a second cross-sectional cohort. Altogether, these data provide global insights into the reconstitution of the immunoregulatory landscape after HSCT and highlight non-canonical IRs associated with relapse, which could open the path to new prognostic tools or therapeutic targets to restore subverted anti-AML immunity."

Previous studies indicated alterations in the cellular immune system; however, it has been challenging to interrogate the role of all immune cell subsets simultaneously. Therefore, we aimed to identify immune cell types associated with inflammation in IBD using high-dimensional mass cytometry. We analyzed 188 intestinal biopsies and paired blood samples of newly-diagnosed, treatment-naive patients (n=42) and controls (n=26) in two independent cohorts. We applied mass cytometry (36-antibody panel) to resolve single cells and analyzed the data with unbiased Hierarchical-SNE. In addition, imaging-mass cytometry (IMC) was performed to reveal the spatial distribution of the immune subsets in the tissue. We identified 44 distinct immune subsets. Correlation network analysis identified a network of inflammation-associated subsets, including HLA-DR+CD38+ EM CD4+ T cells, T regulatory-like cells, PD1+ EM CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, CD27+ TCRγδ cells and NK cells. All disease-associated subsets were validated in a second cohort. This network was abundant in a subset of patients, independent of IBD subtype, severity or intestinal location. Putative disease-associated CD4+ T cells were detectable in blood. Finally, imaging-mass cytometry revealed the spatial colocalization of neutrophils, memory CD4+ T cells and myeloid cells in the inflamed intestine. Our study indicates that a cellular network of both innate and adaptive immune cells colocalizes in inflamed biopsies from a subset of patients. These results contribute to dissecting disease heterogeneity and may guide the development of targeted therapeutics in IBD."

In first trimester, HLA-DR- macrophages represented the most abundant myeloid subcluster and these cells were frequently observed in the vicinity of trophoblasts. At term, HLA-DR+ macrophage subclusters were abundantly present and frequently observed in the microenvironment of T cells. Taken together, our results highlight the dynamic role of myeloid cells at the human maternal-fetal interface throughout gestation."

This mechanism has been exploited for pharmaceutic delivery across an array of diseases to either enhance or diminish this function. Monoclonal antibodies and albumin-bound nanoparticles are examples of FcRn-dependent anti-cancer therapeutics. Despite its importance in drug delivery, little is known about FcRn expression in circulating immune cells. Through time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) we were able to characterize FcRn expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) populations of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients and non-cancer donors. Furthermore, we were able to replicate these findings in an orthotopic murine model of PDAC. Altogether, we found that in both patients and mice with PDAC, FcRn was elevated in migratory and resident classical dendritic cell type 2 (cDC2) as well as monocytic and granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) populations compared to tumor-free controls. Furthermore, PBMCs from PDAC patients had elevated monocyte, dendritic cells and MDSCs relative to non-cancer donor PBMCs. Future investigations into FcRn activity may further elucidate possible mechanisms of poor efficacy of antibody immunotherapies in patients with PDAC."

In recent decades, the cancer research field has gained insight into the cellular subtypes that are involved in tumor microenvironment heterogeneity. Moreover, it has become evident that cellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment can either promote or inhibit tumor development, progression, and drug resistance, depending on the context. Multiplex spatial analysis methods have recently been developed; these have offered insight into how cellular crosstalk dynamics and heterogeneity affect cancer prognoses and responses to treatment. Multiplex (imaging) technologies and computational analysis methods allow for the spatial visualization and quantification of cell-cell interactions and properties. These technological advances allow for the discovery of cellular interactions within the tumor microenvironment and provide detailed single-cell information on properties that define cellular behavior. Such analyses give insights into the prognosis and mechanisms of therapy resistance, which is still an urgent problem in the treatment of multiple types of cancer. Here, we provide an overview of multiplex imaging technologies and concepts of downstream analysis methods to investigate cell-cell interactions, how these studies have advanced cancer research, and their potential clinical implications."

Immunotherapy, with checkpoint inhibitors, have demonstrated limited impact. To evaluate the suitability for immunotherapeutics, contextualized preclinical models are required to secure meaningful clinical translation. Therefore, we developed and characterized humanized patient-derived xenograft (hu PDX) murine models of HGSOC, which were established by orthotopic implantation of tumor cell suspensions and intravenous injection of CD34+ cells isolated from umbilical cord blood samples. The developing human immune system in NSG and NSGS mice was followed longitudinally by flow cytometry and characterized by mass cytometry with a panel of 34 surface markers. Molecular imaging of tumor burden, survival analysis, and characterization of tumor-infiltrating immune cells was performed to assess the treatment response to anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) monotherapy. Successful generation of hu PDX models was achieved. Mice treated with nivolumab showed a decrease in tumor burden, however no significant survival benefit was identified when compared to untreated controls. No correlation was seen between PD-L1 expression and CD8 T cell infiltration and response parameters. As the characterization showed an immune infiltration of predominantly myeloid cells, similar to what is observed in HGSOC patients, the models may have the potential to evaluate the importance of myeloid cell immunomodulation as well."

However, there is a lack of data on antibody levels and the protective effects of booster injections. This study monitored and analyzed the antibody potency and the antibody responses induced by the booster injection in the subjects who received three vaccine doses. The study was conducted in a multicenter collaboration and recruited 360 healthy adults aged 20-74. Participants received the first, second, and booster doses of inactivated Sinopharm/BBIBP COVID-19 vaccine at 0, 1, and 7 months. Vaccine-induced virus-specific antibody levels (SARS-COV-2-IgA/IgM/IgG) were monitored at multiple time points, surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT), and the spatial distribution and proportion of immune cells and markers were analyzed using the CyTOF method before vaccination and a month after the second dose. The titers of SARS-CoV-2-IgA/IgM/IgG and neutralizing antibodies increased to a high level in the first month after receiving the second dose of vaccine and declined slowly after that. The antibody levels of SARS-CoV-2-IgG and sVNT were significantly increased at 0.5 months after the induction of the booster (p < 0.05). Despite a downward trend, the antibody levels were still high in the following 6 months. The B cell concentration (in humoral sample) a month after the second injection was significantly reduced compared to that before the vaccine injection (p < 0.05). The proportion of the C01 cell cluster was significantly decreased compared with that before vaccine injection (p < 0.05). Individual cell surface markers showed distinctions in spatial distribution but were not significantly different. This study has shown that serum antibody titer levels will decrease with time by monitoring and analyzing the antibody efficacy and the antibody reaction caused by the booster injection of healthy people who received the whole vaccination (completed three injections). Still, the significant peak of the antibody titer levels after booster highlights the recall immune response. It can maintain a high concentration of antibody levels for a long time, which signifies that the protection ability has been enhanced following the injection of booster immunization. Additionally, CyTOF data shows the active production of antibodies and the change in the immunity environment."

Herein, a small-molecule probe CDyB for live B cells is developed by an unbiased fluorescence library screening. The cell selectivity was confirmed by multiparametric single-cell analysis using CyTOF. Through a systematic SLC-CRISPRi library screening, the molecular target of CDyB was identified as SLC35C2 transporter based on a gating-oriented live-cell distinction (GOLD) mechanism. The gene expression analysis and knock-out experiments validated that the SLC35C2 transporter was the target for CDyB distinction. Interestingly, when CDyB was applied to study B cell development, the CDyB fluorescence and SLC35C2 expression were positively correlated with the B cell maturation process, and not involved in the T cell development."

Here, we develop CyTOF-Lec as an approach to simultaneously characterize many protein and glycan features of human immune cells at the single-cell level. We implemented CyTOF-Lec to compare glycan features between different immune subsets from blood and multiple tissue compartments, and to characterize HIV-infected cell cultures. Using bioinformatics approaches to distinguish preferential infection of cellular subsets from viral-induced remodeling, we demonstrate that HIV upregulates the levels of cell-surface fucose and sialic acid in a cell-intrinsic manner, and that memory CD4+ T cells co-expressing high levels of fucose and sialic acid are highly susceptible to HIV infection. Sialic acid levels were found to distinguish memory CD4+ T cell subsets expressing different amounts of viral entry receptors, pro-survival factors, homing receptors, and activation markers, and to play a direct role in memory CD4+ T cells' susceptibility to HIV infection. The ability of sialic acid to distinguish memory CD4+ T cells with different susceptibilities to HIV infection was experimentally validated through sorting experiments. Together, these results suggest that HIV remodels not only cellular proteins but also glycans, and that glycan expression can differentiate memory CD4+ T cells with vastly different susceptibility to HIV infection."

One major obstacle is the difficulty identifying cells that harbor latent proviruses. We devised a single-round viral vector that carries a series of versatile reporter molecules that are expressed in an LTR-dependent or LTR-independent manner and make it possible to accurately distinguish productive from latent infection. Using primary human CD4+ T cells, we show that transcriptionally silent proviruses are found in more than 50% of infected cells. The latently infected cells harbor proviruses but lack evidence for multiple spliced transcripts. LTR-silent integrations occurred to variable degrees in all CD4+ T subsets examined, with CD4+ TEM and CD4+ TREG displaying the highest frequency of latent infections. This viral vector permits the interrogation of HIV latency at single-cell resolution, revealing mechanisms of latency establishment and allowing the characterization of effective latency-reversing agents."

Working with lymphoid cells from human tonsils, we characterized the HIV-associated depletion of various CD4 T cell subsets using mass cytometry and single-cell RNA-seq. CD4 T cell subsets preferentially killed by HIV are phenotypically distinct from those resistant to HIV-associated cell death, in a manner not fully accounted for by their susceptibility to productive infection. Preferentially-killed subsets express CXCR5 and CXCR4 while preferentially-infected subsets exhibit an activated and exhausted effector memory cell phenotype. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis reveals that the subsets of preferentially-killed cells express genes favoring abortive infection and pyroptosis. These studies emphasize a complex interplay between HIV and distinct tissue-based CD4 T cell subsets, and the important contribution of abortive infection and inflammatory programmed cell death to the overall depletion of CD4 T cells that accompanies untreated HIV infection."

These changes, together with increases in regulatory T cells and reduced signaling in basophils, also accompanied recovery from respiratory failure and were associated with better outcomes at time of admission. Therefore, although patients have heterogeneous immunological baselines and highly variable disease courses, a core immunological trajectory exists that defines recovery from severe SARS-CoV-2 infection."

With current therapies, more than 90% of patients with CHD survive into adulthood, but many suffer premature death from heart failure and non-cardiac causes1. Here, to gain insight into this disease progression, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing on 157,273 nuclei from control hearts and hearts from patients with CHD, including those with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) and tetralogy of Fallot, two common forms of cyanotic CHD lesions, as well as dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies. We observed CHD-specific cell states in cardiomyocytes, which showed evidence of insulin resistance and increased expression of genes associated with FOXO signalling and CRIM1. Cardiac fibroblasts in HLHS were enriched in a low-Hippo and high-YAP cell state characteristic of activated cardiac fibroblasts. Imaging mass cytometry uncovered a spatially resolved perivascular microenvironment consistent with an immunodeficient state in CHD. Peripheral immune cell profiling suggested deficient monocytic immunity in CHD, in agreement with the predilection in CHD to infection and cancer2. Our comprehensive phenotyping of CHD provides a roadmap towards future personalized treatments for CHD."

PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors have been used as second-line therapy for urothelial carcinoma due to the high tumor mutational burden. Despite the efficacy of the treatment is significant, the response rate is still poor. The tumor immune microenvironment plays a key role in the regulation of immunotherapeutic efficacy. However, a comprehensive understanding of the intricate microenvironment in clinical samples remains unclear. To obtain detailed systematic tumor immune profile, we performed an in-depth immunoassay on 12 human urothelial carcinoma tissue samples and 14 paratumor tissue samples using mass cytometry. Among the large number of cells assayed, we identified 71 T-cell phenotypes, 30 tumor-associated macrophage phenotypes. T cell marker expression profiles showed that almost all T cells in the tumor tissue were in a state of exhaustion. CD38 expression on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) was significantly higher than PDL1, and CD38+ TAMs were closely associated with immunosuppression. CD38 may be a more suitable target for immunotherapy in urothelial carcinoma compared to PD1/PDL1. This single-cell analysis of clinical samples expands our insights into the immune microenvironment of urothelial carcinoma and reveals potential biomarkers and targets for immunotherapy development."

To guide the design of more effective immunotherapy strategies, mass cytometry was employed to characterize the cellular composition of the PDAC-infiltrating immune cells. The expression of 33 protein markers was examined at the single-cell level in more than two million immune cells from four types of clinical samples, including PDAC tumors, normal pancreatic tissues, chronic pancreatitis tissues, and peripheral blood. Based on the analyses, we identified 23 distinct T-cell phenotypes, with some cell clusters exhibiting aberrant frequencies in the tumors. Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) was extensively expressed in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and coexpressed with both stimulatory and inhibitory immune markers. In addition, we observed elevated levels of functional markers, such as CD137L and CD69, in PDAC-infiltrating immune cells. Moreover, the combination of PD-1 and CD8 was used to stratify PDAC tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas database into three immune subtypes, with S1 (PD-1+CD8+) exhibiting the best prognosis. Further analysis suggested distinct molecular mechanisms for immune exclusion in different subtypes. Taken together, the single-cell protein expression data depicted a detailed cell atlas of the PDAC-infiltrating immune cells and revealed clinically relevant information regarding useful cell phenotypes and targets for immunotherapy development."

Integration of metabolic imaging and imaging mass cytometry uncovered locoregional tumor-host interdependence, resulting in spatially exclusive adaptive transcriptional programs.

Recent paradigm-changing studies have shown that natural killer (NK) cells exhibit innate memory upon brief activation with IL-12 and IL-18, leading to cytokine-induced memory-like (CIML) NK cell differentiation. CIML NK cells have enhanced antitumor activity and have shown promising results in early phase clinical trials in patients with relapsed/refractory AML. Here, we show that arming CIML NK cells with a neoepitope-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) significantly enhances their antitumor responses to nucleophosphmin-1 (NPM1)-mutated AML while avoiding off-target toxicity. CIML NK cells differentiated from peripheral blood NK cells were efficiently transduced to express a TCR-like CAR that specifically recognizes a neoepitope derived from the cytosolic oncogenic NPM1-mutated protein presented by HLA-A2. These CAR CIML NK cells displayed enhanced activity against NPM1-mutated AML cell lines and patient-derived leukemic blast cells. CAR CIML NK cells persisted in vivo and significantly improved AML outcomes in xenograft models. Single-cell RNA sequencing and mass cytometry analyses identified up-regulation of cell proliferation, protein folding, immune responses, and major metabolic pathways in CAR-transduced CIML NK cells, resulting in tumor-specific, CAR-dependent activation and function in response to AML target cells. Thus, efficient arming of CIML NK cells with an NPM1-mutation-specific TCR-like CAR substantially improves their innate antitumor responses against an otherwise intracellular mutant protein. These preclinical findings justify evaluating this approach in clinical trials in HLA-A2+ AML patients with NPM1c mutations."

To understand the poor response of DLBCL to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), we compared our results to IMC data from Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer highly responsive to ICI, and observed differences in the expression of PD-L1, PD-1, and TIM-3. We created a spatial classification of tumor cells and identified tumor-centric subregions of immune activation, immune suppression, and immune exclusion within the topology of DLBCL. Finally, the spatial analysis allowed us to identify markers such as CXCR3, which are associated with penetration of immune cells into immune desert regions, with important implications for engineered cellular therapies. This is the first study to integrate tumor mutational profiling, cell of origin classification, and multiplexed immuno-phenotyping of the TME into a spatial analysis of DLBCL at the single-cell level. We demonstrate that, far from being histopathologically monotonous, DLBCL has a complex tumor architecture, and that changes in tumor topology can be correlated with clinically relevant features.

Epub 2022 Jun 3.,Keywords: anthracyclines; cardiotoxicity; nonmyocytes; single cell.,"Childhood cancer survivors (CCSs) face lifelong side effects related to their treatment with chemotherapy. Anthracycline agents, such as doxorubicin (DOX), are important in the treatment of childhood cancers but are associated with cardiotoxicity. Cardiac toxicities represent a significant source of chronic disability that cancer survivors face; despite this, the chronic cardiotoxicity phenotype and how it relates to acute toxicity remains poorly defined. To address this critical knowledge gap, we studied the acute effect of DOX on murine cardiac nonmyocytes in vivo. Determination of the acute cellular effects of DOX on nonmyocytes, a cell pool with finite replicative capacity, provides a basis for understanding the pathogenesis of the chronic heart disease that CCSs face. To investigate the acute cellular effects of DOX, we present single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data from homeostatic cardiac nonmyocytes and compare it with preexisting datasets, as well as a novel CyTOF datasets. SCANPY, a python-based single-cell analysis, was used to assess the heterogeneity of cells detected in scRNAseq and CyTOF. To further assist in CyTOF data annotation, joint analyses of scRNAseq and CyTOF data using an artificial neural network known as sparse autoencoder for clustering, imputation, and embedding (SAUCIE) are performed. Lastly, the panel is tested on a mouse model of acute DOX exposure at two time points (24 and 72 h) after the last dose of doxorubicin and examined with joint clustering. In sum, we report the first ever CyTOF study of cardiac nonmyocytes and characterize the effect of acute DOX exposure with scRNAseq and CyTOF.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We describe the first mass cytometry studies of murine cardiac nonmyocytes. The mass cytometry panel is compared with single-cell RNA sequencing data. Homeostatic cardiac nonmyocytes are characterized by mass cytometry to identify and quantify four major cell populations: endothelial cells, fibroblasts, leukocytes, and pericytes.

Abnormally activated B cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of SLE, but their measure in clinical practice is currently not recommended. Here, we studied peripheral B cells to identify a valid biomarker. We analyzed peripheral B cells in a discovery cohort of 30 SLE patients compared to 30 healthy controls (HC) using mass cytometry and unsupervised clustering analysis. The relevant B cell populations were subsequently studied by flow cytometry in a validation cohort of 63 SLE patients, 28 autoimmune diseases controls and 39 HC. Our data show an increased frequency of B cell populations with activated phenotype in SLE compared to healthy and autoimmune diseases controls. These cells uniformly lacked the expression of CD21 and CD27. Measurement of CD21-CD27- B cells in the blood identified patients with active disease and their frequency correlated with disease severity. Interestingly, we did not observe an increase in the frequency of CD21-CD27- B cells in patients with clinically inactive disease but with elevated conventional biomarkers (anti-dsDNA and complement levels). Accordingly, measurement of CD21-CD27- B cells represents a robust and easily accessible biomarker to assess the activity of the disease in SLE patients."

Although newer therapeutic options are potentially highly efficacious, their costs outweigh the effectiveness. Previously, we have established that clofazimine (CLF) activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, synergizes with primary therapies, and targets cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) in drug-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. In this study, we used a panel of human myeloma cell lines as in vitro model systems representing drug-sensitive, innate/refractory, and clonally-derived acquired/relapsed PI- and cereblon (CRBN)-negative IMiD-resistant myeloma and bone marrow-derived CD138+ primary myeloma cells obtained from patients as ex vivo models to demonstrate that CLF shows significant cytotoxicity against drug-resistant myeloma as single-agent and in combination with PIs and IMiDs. Next, using genome-wide transcriptome analysis (RNA-sequencing), single-cell proteomics (CyTOF; Cytometry by time-of-flight), and ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA), we identified novel pathways associated with CLF efficacy, including induction of ER stress, autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative phosphorylation, enhancement of downstream cascade of p65-NFkB-IRF4-Myc downregulation, and ROS-dependent apoptotic cell death in myeloma. Further, we also showed that CLF is effective in killing rare refractory subclones like side populations that have been referred to as myeloma stem-like cells. Since CLF is an FDA-approved drug and also on WHO's list of safe and effective essential medicines, it has strong potential to be rapidly re-purposed as a safe and cost-effective anti-myeloma drug."

We synthesized a peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) molecular inhibitor, ZD-E-1M. It could self-assembled into nanodrug ZD-E-1. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy, we observed its cellular colocalization, PAD4 activity and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation. The populations of immune cells and expression of immune-related proteins were determined by single-cell mass cytometry. ZD-E-1 formed nanoflowers in an acidic environment, whereas it formed nanospheres at pH 7.4. Accumulation of ZD-E-1 at tumor was pH-responsive because of its pH-dependent differences in the size and shape. It could enter the nucleus and bind to PAD4 to prolong the intracellular retention time. In mice, ZD-E-1 inhibited tumor growth and metastasis by inhibiting PAD4 activity and NETs formation. Besides, ZD-E-1 could regulate the ratio of immune cells in LLC tumor-bearing mice. Immunosuppressive proteins like LAG3 were suppressed, while IFN-γ and TNF-α as stimulators of tumor immune response were upregulated. Overall, ZD-E-1 is a self-assembling carrier-free nanodrug that responds to pH, inhibits PAD4 activity, blocks neutrophil extracellular traps formation, and improves the tumor immune microenvironment."

Online ahead of print.,Keywords: Effector T cells; GSK3β; PCBP1; Regulatory T cells; WNT.,"Loss of expression or protein kinase B (Akt1)-mediated post-translational modification of the RNA binding protein Poly r(C) binding protein 1 (PCBP1) is closely related to metastatic advancement of breast cancer. However, the role of PCBP1 in tumorigenesis is not completely defined. Using a xenograft orthotopic model of breast tumorigenesis (4T1-Pcbp1-/-), we show here that PCBP1 knockdown-induced tumorigenesis is inhibited by activation of the WNT signaling via treating with the glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta inhibitor TWS119, but not the Akt2/Akt3 inhibitor GSK690693. Mass cytometry-based evaluation of the tumor microenvironment (TME) revealed significantly more regulatory T cells (Tregs) and significantly less cytotoxic T cells in 4T1-Pcbp1-/-mice treated with saline control in comparison to mice treated with TWS119. Infiltrating cytotoxic T cells were phenotypically and functionally exhausted. Treatment with TWS119 resulted in rescue of cytotoxic T cell function and inhibition of suppressor activity of Tregs. Using cytotoxic T cells isolated from healthy donors, we show that TWS119-induced WNT signaling-mediated inhibition of cytotoxic T cell expansion is reliant on expression of PCBP1. In conclusion, decreased PCBP1 expression favors breast tumorigenesis by potentiating skewing of tumor infiltrating T cells towards Tregs, thereby effectively suppressing anti-tumor immunity."

This project used multi-dimensional profiling techniques to comprehensively characterize injury responsive Tregs in mice. We show that CD44high Tregs expand in response to injury and were highly suppressive when compared to CD44low Tregs. T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire analysis revealed that the CD44high Treg population undergo TCRαβ clonal expansion as well as increased TCR CDR3 diversity. Bulk RNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing with paired TCR clonotype analysis identified unique differences between CD44high and CD44low Tregs and specific upregulation of genes in Tregs with expanded TCR clonotypes. Gene ontology analysis for molecular function of RNA sequencing data identified chemokine receptors and cell division as the most enriched functional terms in CD44high Tregs versus CD44low Tregs. Mass cytometry (CyTOF) analysis of Tregs from injured and uninjured mice verified protein expression of these genes on CD44high Tregs, with injury-induced increases in Helios, Galectin-3 and PYCARD expression. Taken together, these data indicate that injury triggers the expansion of a highly suppressive CD44high Treg population that is transcriptionally and phenotypically distinct from CD44low Tregs suggesting that they actively participate in controlling immune responses to injury and tissue damage."

Although TFH were first discovered through their ability to contribute to antibody affinity maturation through co-stimulatory interactions with B cells, new light has been shed on their ability to remain a complex and functionally plastic cell type. Due to a lack sample availability, however, many studies have been limited to characterizing TFH in mice or non-canonical tissue types, such as peripheral blood. Such constraints have resulted in a limited, and sometimes contradictory, understanding of this fundamental cell type. One subset of TFH receiving attention in chronic infection are CXCR3-expressing TFH cells (CXCR3+TFH) due to their abnormal accumulation in secondary lymphoid tissues. Their function and clonal relationship with other TFH subsets in lymphoid tissues during infection, however, remains largely unclear. We thus systematically investigated this and other subsets of TFH within untreated HIV-infected human lymph nodes using Mass CyTOF and a combination of RNA and TCR repertoire sequencing. We show an inflation of the CXCR3+TFH compartment during HIV infection that correlates with a lower HIV burden. Deeper analysis into this population revealed a functional shift of CXCR3+TFH away from germinal center TFH (GC-TFH), including the altered expression of several important transcription factors and cytokines. CXCR3+TFH also upregulated cell migration transcriptional programs and were clonally related to peripheral TFH populations. In combination, these data suggest that CXCR3+TFH have a greater tendency to enter circulation than their CXCR3- counterparts, potentially functioning through distinct modalities that may lead to enhanced defense."

GCA is a highly heterogeneous disease in terms of clinical and histological findings, pathophysiology, and treatment selection strategies. The disease is highly responsive to glucocorticosteroids (GCs), but almost half of patients may relapse following GCs tapering. The main hypothesis of GCA pathogenesis includes altered immune responses and changes in the vascular microenvironment, leading to a dynamic interplay between innate and adaptive immunity. The aim of this study is to explore the effect of GCs on the phenotype of peripheral mononuclear cell subpopulations and on the major inflammatory molecules detected in the peripheral blood of patients during the acute phase of the disease."

Due to the heterogeneity of the clinical presentation, the diagnosis of SLE remains complicated and is often made years after the first symptoms manifest, delaying treatment, and worsening the prognosis. Several studies have shown that signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family (SLAMF) receptors are aberrantly expressed and dysfunctional in SLE immune cells, contributing to the altered cellular function observed in these patients. The aim of this study was to determine whether altered co-/expression of SLAMF receptors on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) identifies SLE characteristic cell populations. To this end, single cell mass cytometry and bioinformatic analysis were exploited to compare SLE patients to healthy and autoimmune diseases controls. First, the expression of each SLAMF receptor on all PBMC populations was investigated. We observed that SLAMF1+ B cells (referred to as SLEB1) were increased in SLE compared to controls. Furthermore, the frequency of SLAMF4+ monocytes and SLAMF4+ NK were inversely correlated with disease activity, whereas the frequency SLAMF1+ CD4+ TDEM cells were directly correlated with disease activity. Consensus clustering analysis identified two cell clusters that presented significantly increased frequency in SLE compared to controls: switch memory B cells expressing SLAMF1, SLAMF3, SLAMF5, SLAMF6 (referred to as SLESMB) and circulating T follicular helper cells expressing the same SLAMF receptors (referred to as SLEcTFH). Finally, the robustness of the identified cell populations as biomarkers for SLE was evaluated through ROC curve analysis. The combined measurement of SLEcTFH and SLEB1 or SLESMB cells identified SLE patients in 90% of cases. In conclusion, this study identified an immune signature for SLE based on the expression of SLAMF receptors on PBMC, further highlighting the involvement of SLAMF receptors in the pathogenesis of SLE."

Recently, however, with the introduction of full spectrum flow cytometry (FSFC), it has become possible to break the fluorescence barrier and go beyond 29 fluorescent parameters. In this study, in collaboration with the Stanford Human Immune Monitoring Center (HIMC), we compared five patient samples using an established immune panel developed by the HIMC using their MC platform. Using split samples and the same antibody panel, we were able to demonstrate highly comparable results between the two technologies using multiple data analysis approaches. We report here a direct comparison of two technology platforms (MC and FSFC) using a 32-marker flow cytometric immune monitoring panel that can identify all the previously described and anticipated immune subpopulations defined by this panel."

It remains a challenge to analyze such high-dimensional data to exploit the richness of the inherent information, even though many valuable new analysis tools have already been developed. We propose a novel algorithm ""pattern recognition of immune cells (PRI)"" to tackle these high-dimensional protein combinations in the data. PRI is a tool for the analysis and visualization of cytometry data based on a three or more-parametric binning approach, feature engineering of bin properties of multivariate cell data, and a pseudo-multiparametric visualization. Using a publicly available mass cytometry dataset, we proved that reproducible feature engineering and intuitive understanding of the generated bin plots are helpful hallmarks for re-analysis with PRI. In the CD4+T cell population analyzed, PRI revealed two bin-plot patterns (CD90/CD44/CD86 and CD90/CD44/CD27) and 20 bin plot features for threshold-independent classification of mice concerning ineffective and effective tumor treatment. In addition, PRI mapped cell subsets regarding co-expression of the proliferation marker Ki67 with two major transcription factors and further delineated a specific Th1 cell subset. All these results demonstrate the added insights that can be obtained using the non-cluster-based tool PRI for re-analyses of high-dimensional cytometric data."

Epub 2021 Jun 8.,Keywords: 2D materials; Biocompatibility; Carbon materials; Cytotoxicity; Safety; Single-cell.,"Given the wide variety of potential applications of graphene oxide (GO), its consequent release into the environment poses serious concerns on its safety. The future production and exploitation of graphene in the years to come should be guided by its specific chemical-physical characteristics. The unparalleled potential of single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) to dissect by high-dimensionality the specific immunological effects of nanomaterials, represents a turning point in nanotoxicology. It helps us to identify the safe graphene in terms of physical-chemical properties and therefore to direct its future safe production. Here we present a high-dimensional study to evaluate two historically indicated as key parameters for the safe exploitation: functionalization and dimension. The role of lateral dimension and the amino-functionalization of GO on their immune impact were here evaluated as synergistic players. To this end, we dissected the effects of GO, characterized by a large or small lateral size (GO 1.32 μm and GO 0.13 μm, respectively), and its amino-functionalized counterpart (GONH2 1.32 μm and GONH2 0.13 μm, respectively) on fifteen cell types of human primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We describe how the smallest later size not only evokes pronounced toxicity on the pool of PBMCs compared to larger GOs but also towards the distinct immune cell subpopulations, in particular on non-classical monocytes, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), natural killer cells (NKs) and B cells. The amino-functionalization was able to improve the biocompatibility of classical and non-classical monocytes, pDCs, NKs, and B cells. Detailed single-cell analysis further revealed a complex interaction of all GOs with the immune cells, and in particular monocyte subpopulations, with different potency depending on their physicochemical properties. Overall, by high-dimensional profiling, our study demonstrates that the lateral dimension is an important factor modulating immune cells and specifically monocyte activation, but a proper surface functionalization is the dominant characteristic in its immune effects. In particular, the amino-functionalization can critically modify graphene impact dampening the immune cell activation. Our study can serve as a guide for the future broad production and use of graphene in our everyday life."

Despite research efforts to define the role of various immune cells in MS pathogenesis, the focus has been on a few immune cell populations while full-spectrum analysis, encompassing others such as natural killer (NK) cells, has not been performed. Here, we used single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) to profile the immune landscape of brain periventricular areas - septum and choroid plexus - and of the circulation from donors with MS, dementia and controls without neurological disease. Using a 37-marker panel, we revealed the infiltration of T cells and antibody-secreting cells in periventricular brain regions and identified a novel NK cell signature specific to MS. CD56bright NK cells were accumulated in the septum of MS donors and displayed an activated and migratory phenotype, similar to that of CD56bright NK cells in the circulation. We validated this signature by multiplex immunohistochemistry and found that the number of NK cells with high expression of granzyme K, typical of the CD56bright subset, was increased in both periventricular lesions and the choroid plexus of donors with MS. Together, our multi-tissue single-cell data shows that CD56bright NK cells accumulate in the periventricular brain regions of MS patients, bringing NK cells back to the spotlight of MS pathology."

Heterotypic multicellular spheroids are three-dimensional (3D) spherical structures generated by self-assembly from aggregates of two or more cell types. Compared to traditional monolayer cell culture models, the organization of cells into a 3D tissue-like structure favors relevant physiological conditions with chemical and physical gradients as well as cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions that recapitulate many of the hallmarks of cancer in situ. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are prevalent in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet various mechanisms of acquired resistance, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), limit the clinical benefit of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFRi). Improved preclinical models that incorporate the complexity induced by epithelial-to-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) are urgently needed to advance new therapeutics for clinical NSCLC management. This study was designed to provide a thorough characterization of multicellular spheroids of isogenic cancer cells of various phenotypes and demonstrate proof-of-principle for the applicability of the presented spheroid model to evaluate the impact of cancer cell phenotype in drug screening experiments through high-dimensional and spatially resolved imaging mass cytometry (IMC) analyses. First, we developed and characterized 3D homotypic and heterotypic spheroid models comprising EGFRi-sensitive or EGFRi-resistant NSCLC cells. We observed that the degree of EMT correlated with the spheroid generation efficiency in monocultures. In-depth characterization of the multicellular heterotypic spheroids using immunohistochemistry and high-dimensional single-cell analyses by IMC revealed intrinsic differences between epithelial and mesenchymal-like cancer cells with respect to self-sorting, spatiotemporal organization, and stromal cell interactions when co-cultured with fibroblasts. While the carcinoma cells harboring an epithelial phenotype self-organized into a barrier sheet surrounding the fibroblasts, mesenchymal-like carcinoma cells localized to the central hypoxic and collagen-rich areas of the compact heterotypic spheroids. Further, deep-learning-based single-cell segmentation of IMC images and application of dimensionality reduction algorithms allowed a detailed visualization and multiparametric analysis of marker expression across the different cell subsets. We observed a high level of heterogeneity in the expression of EMT markers in both the carcinoma cell populations and the fibroblasts. Our study supports further application of these models in pre-clinical drug testing combined with complementary high-dimensional single-cell analyses, which in turn can advance our understanding of the impact of cancer-stroma interactions and epithelial phenotypic plasticity on innate and acquired therapy resistance in NSCLC."

Mass cytometry by time-of-flight analysis was performed on 299, 570 single cells from nLung, SSN-LUAD and SN-LUAD tissues. The immune cells were identified by phenotype, and the percentages of different immune cell subclusters were compared between SSN-LUADs, SN-LUADs and nLungs. Elevated percentage of CD8+ T cells were identified in SSN-LUADs compared with in nLungs and SN-LUADs.

Mass cytometry is also a powerful tool for single-cell immunological assays, especially for complex and simultaneous characterization of diverse intratumoral immune subsets or immunotherapeutic cell populations. Through the elimination of spectral overlap seen in optical flow cytometry by replacement of fluorescent labels with metal isotopes, mass cytometry allows, on average, robust analysis of 60 individual parameters simultaneously. This is, however, associated with significantly increased complexity in the design, execution, and interpretation of mass cytometry experiments. To address the key pitfalls associated with the fragmentation, complexity, and analysis of data in mass cytometry for immunologists who are novices to these techniques, we have developed a comprehensive resource guide. Included in this review are experiment and panel design, antibody conjugations, sample staining, sample acquisition, and data pre-processing and analysis. Where feasible multiple resources for the same process are compared, allowing researchers experienced in flow cytometry but with minimal mass cytometry expertise to develop a data-driven and streamlined project workflow. It is our hope that this manuscript will prove a useful resource for both beginning and advanced users of mass cytometry."

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has transformed cancer medicine, with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) therapy now well-utilized for treating NSCLC. Still, not all patients with NSCLC respond positively to anti-PD-1 therapy, and some patients acquire resistance to treatment. There remains an urgent need to find markers predictive of anti-PD-1 responsiveness. To this end, we performed mass cytometry on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 26 patients with NSCLC during anti-PD-1 treatment. Patients who responded to anti-PD-1 ICB displayed significantly higher levels of antigen-presenting myeloid cells, including CD9+ nonclassical monocytes, and CD33hi classical monocytes. Using matched pre-post treatment samples, we found that the baseline pre-treatment frequencies of CD33hi monocytes predicted patient responsiveness to anti-PD-1 therapy. Moreover, some of these classical and nonclassical monocyte subsets were associated with reduced immunosuppression by T regulatory (CD4+FOXP3+CD25+) cells in the same patients. Our use of machine learning corroborated the association of specific monocyte markers with responsiveness to ICB. Our work provides a high-dimensional profile of monocytes in NSCLC and links CD33 expression on monocytes with anti-PD-1 effectiveness in patients with NSCLC."

Metastases to the spine result in fractures, pain, paralysis, and significant health care costs. This predilection for cancer to metastasize to the bone is seen across most cancer histologies, with the greatest incidence seen in prostate, breast, and lung cancer. The molecular process involved in this predilection for axial versus appendicular skeleton is not fully understood, although it is likely that a combination of tumor and local micro-environmental factors plays a role. Immune cells are an important constituent of the bone marrow microenvironment and many of these cells have been shown to play a significant role in tumor growth and progression in soft tissue and bone disease. With this in mind, we sought to examine the differences in immune landscape between axial and appendicular bones in the normal noncancerous setting in order to obtain an understanding of these landscapes. To accomplish this, we utilized mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) to examine differences in the immune cell landscapes between the long bone and vertebral body bone marrow from patient clinical samples and C57BL/6J mice. We demonstrate significant differences between immune populations in both murine and human marrow with a predominance of myeloid progenitor cells in the spine. Additionally, cytokine analysis revealed differences in concentrations favoring a more myeloid enriched population of cells in the vertebral body bone marrow. These differences could have clinical implications with respect to the distribution and permissive growth of bone metastases."

Historically, asymptomatic malaria has been viewed as beneficial and required to help maintain clinical immunity. Emerging views suggest that these infections are detrimental and constitute a parasite reservoir that perpetuates transmission. To define the impact of asymptomatic malaria, we pursued a systems approach integrating antibody responses, mass cytometry, and transcriptional profiling of individuals experiencing symptomatic and asymptomatic P. falciparum infection. Defined populations of classical and atypical memory B cells and a TH2 cell bias were associated with reduced risk of clinical malaria. Despite these protective responses, asymptomatic malaria featured an immunosuppressive transcriptional signature with upregulation of pathways involved in the inhibition of T-cell function, and CTLA-4 as a predicted regulator in these processes. As proof of concept, we demonstrated a role for CTLA-4 in the development of asymptomatic parasitemia in infection models. The results suggest that asymptomatic malaria is not innocuous and might not support the induction of immune processes to fully control parasitemia or efficiently respond to malaria vaccines."

The bladder microenvironment of patients with IC/BPS to obtain biological evidence supporting diagnosis and novel therapy is systematically characterized. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and image mass cytometry (IMC) are applied to bladder biopsies of the IC/BPS cohort. A total of 42 distinct cell clusters are identified from different groups. The increased hyperactivated Th1-biased response, but not Th2-biased response, and decreased immunosuppressive Treg are elucidated in the bladder microenvironment of non-Hunner-type IC (NHIC)/Hunner-type IC (HIC). M2/M2-like macrophage extends in the HIC and M1-like macrophage extends in NHIC, all of which secrete a range of chemokines with different pattern. The pro-inflammatory mediators, TNF-α, produced by tissue-resident macrophages and IL6, by the inflammatory fibroblasts are identified as key mediators of IC/BPS pathogenesis. Additionally, a regulatory network between different cell types is observed as a shift from structural cell communication in unaffected normal bladder to a Macrophage-Endothelial-dominated interactome in NHIC/HIC. The results demonstrate the high heterogeneity in NHIC/HIC, and provide an essential resource for diagnosis, and treatment of IC/BPS in the future by highlighting the importance of the microenvironment of bladder mucosa."

Furthermore, pGVHD pathogenesis is not fully elucidated in humans, and currently available immunosuppressants are inadequately effective. We performed pathologic evaluation of lung specimens from 45 allo-HSCT recipients with pGVHD who underwent lung transplantation. Patient pathology was characterized by bronchiolitis and subpleural perivascular inflammation, with B-cell, monocyte, and T-cell accumulation around bronchioles. Bronchiolitis, perivascular inflammation, and peribronchial macrophage aggregation were also identified in a murine pGVHD model after transplant of bone marrow cells and splenocytes from C57BL/6 to B10.BR mice. Among mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors, cobimetinib, but not trametinib, improved survival rates. Cobimetinib attenuated bronchiolitis, improved airway resistance and lung compliance in the mice, and suppressed activation of B cells and tumor necrosis factor α production by monocytes in vitro; these features were not suppressed by trametinib or tacrolimus. Furthermore, cobimetinib suppressed activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling, resulting in B-cell and monocyte suppression. Dual inhibition of the MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and PI3K/AKT pathways using a combination of trametinib and the PI3K inhibitor taselisib strongly suppressed B-cell activation in vitro and improved mouse survival rates compared with vehicle or monotherapy with trametinib or taselisib. Imaging mass cytometry of human pGVHD revealed that T cells around bronchioles were positive for phosphorylated ERK, whereas B cells were positive for phosphorylated AKT. Thus, perivascular inflammation and bronchiolitis mediated by activation of the MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways are essential for pGVHD and represent a potential novel therapeutic target in humans."

We performed mass cytometry to quantify immune cell subsets in lungs of 12 patients with IPF and 15 organ donors without chronic lung disease and used existing single-cell RNA-sequencing data to investigate transcriptional profiles of immune cells overrepresented in IPF. Among myeloid cells, we found increased numbers of alveolar macrophages (AMØs) and dendritic cells (DCs) in IPF, as well as a subset of monocyte-derived DCs. In contrast, monocyte-like cells and interstitial macrophages were reduced in IPF. Transcriptomic profiling identified an enrichment for IFN-γ response pathways in AMØs and DCs from IPF, as well as antigen processing in DCs and phagocytosis in AMØs. Among T cells, we identified three subsets of memory T cells that were increased in IPF, including CD4+ and CD8+ resident memory T cells (TRM) and CD8+ effector memory cells. The response to the IFN-γ pathway was enriched in CD4 TRM and CD8 TRM cells in IPF, together with T cell activation and immune response-regulating signaling pathways. Increased AMØs, DCs, and memory T cells were present in IPF lungs compared with control subjects. In IPF, these cells possess an activation profile indicating increased IFN-γ signaling and upregulation of adaptive immunity in the lungs. Together, these studies highlight critical features of the immunopathogenesis of IPF."

Most studies rely on platforms that remove intrahepatic macrophages from the microenvironment prior to evaluation. Cell isolation causes activation and phenotypic changes that may not represent their actual biology and function in situ. State-of-the-art methods provides new strategies to study TAMs without losing the context of tissue architecture and spatial relationship with neighboring cells. These technologies, such as multispectral imaging (e.g., Vectra Polaris), mass cytometry by time-of-flight (e.g., Fluidigm CyTOF), cycling of fluorochromes (e.g., Akoya Biosciences CODEX/PhenoCycler-Fusion, Bruker Canopy, Lunaphore Comet, and CyCIF) and digital spatial profiling or transcriptomics (e.g., GeoMx or Visium, Vizgen Merscope) are being utilized to accurately assess the complex cellular network within the tissue microenvironment. In cancer research, these platforms enable characterization of immune cell phenotypes and expression of potential therapeutic targets, such as PDL-1 and CTLA-4. Newer spatial profiling platforms allow for detection of numerous protein targets, in combination with whole transcriptome analysis, in a single liver biopsy tissue section. Macrophages can also be specifically targeted and analyzed, enabling quantification of both protein and gene expression within specific cell phenotypes, including TAMs. This review describes the workflow of each platform, summarizes recent research using these approaches, and explains the advantages and limitations of each."

We investigated the immunomodulating effects of Pleurotus eryngii mushrooms, selected due to their high β-glucan content, strong lactogenic effect, and potent geno-protective properties, following in vitro fermentation by fecal inocula from healthy elderly volunteers (>60 years old). The immunomodulating properties of the fermentation supernatants (FSs) were initially investigated in U937-derived human macrophages. Gene expression as well as pro- (TNF-α, IL-1β) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-1Rα) were assessed and correlated with the fermentation process. The presence of P. eryngii in the fermentation process led to modifications in immune response, as indicated by the altered gene expression and levels of the cytokines examined, a finding consistent for all volunteers.

To develop less invasive but equally effective treatment options, one needs to first have a comprehensive understanding of the bone healing process. Therefore, it is imperative to leverage the most advanced technologies to elucidate the fundamental concepts of the bone healing process and develop innovative therapeutic strategies to bridge the nonunion gap. In this review, we first discuss the current animal models to study critical-size bone defects. Then, we focus on four novel analytic techniques and discuss their strengths and limitations. These four technologies are mass cytometry (CyTOF) for enhanced cellular analysis, imaging mass cytometry (IMC) for enhanced tissue special imaging, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) for detailed transcriptome analysis, and Luminex assays for comprehensive protein secretome analysis. With this new understanding of the healing of critical-size bone defects, novel methods of diagnosis and treatment will emerge."

Our analysis shows that multiple functional B cell subsets produce IL-10 and that no phenotype uniquely identifies IL-10+ B cells. Further, a significant portion of IL-10+ B cells co-express the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). Despite this heterogeneity, operationally tolerant liver transplant recipients have a unique enrichment of IL-10+, but not TNFα+ or IL-6+, B cells compared with transplant recipients receiving immunosuppression. Thus, human IL-10-producing B cells constitute an induced, transient state arising from a diversity of B cell subsets that may contribute to maintenance of immune homeostasis."

Emerging single cell immunoprofiling technologies have shown promise in discerning mechanisms of autoimmunity and cancer immunobiology. Within these applications, Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) has been shown to enable highly multiplexed, single cell analysis of immune phenotypes within fixed tissue specimens. In this study, an IMC panel of 10 validated markers was developed to explore the feasibility of IMC in characterizing the immune landscape of chronic rejection (CR) in clinical tissue samples obtained from liver transplant recipients. IMC staining was highly specific and comparable to traditional immunohistochemistry. A single cell segmentation analysis pipeline was developed that enabled detailed visualization and quantification of 109,245 discrete cells, including 30,646 immune cells. Dimensionality reduction identified 11 unique immune subpopulations in CR specimens. Most immune subpopulations were increased and spatially related in CR, including two populations of CD45+/CD3+/CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells and a discrete CD68+ macrophage population, which were not observed in liver with no rejection (NR). Modeling via principal component analysis and logistic regression revealed that single cell data can be utilized to construct statistical models with high consistency (Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, p=0.000036). This study highlights the power of IMC to investigate the alloimmune microenvironment at a single cell resolution during clinical rejection episodes. Further validation of IMC has the potential to detect new biomarkers, identify therapeutic targets, and generate patient-specific predictive models of clinical outcomes in solid organ transplantation."

We evaluated MISTy on in silico and breast cancer datasets measured by imaging mass cytometry and spatial transcriptomics. We estimated structural and functional interactions coming from different spatial contexts in breast cancer and demonstrated how to relate MISTy's results to clinical features."

Immune dysfunction includes insufficient immune lesion clearance, a pro-inflammatory endometrial environment, and systemic inflammation. Comprehensive understanding of endometriosis immune pathophysiology in different hormonal milieu and disease severity has been hampered by limited direct characterization of immune populations in endometrium, blood, and lesions. Simultaneous deep phenotyping at single-cell resolution of complex tissues has transformed our understanding of the immune system and its role in many diseases. Herein, we report mass cytometry and high dimensional analyses to study immune cell phenotypes, abundance, activation states, and functions in endometrium and blood of women with and without endometriosis in different cycle phases and disease stages."

Dysregulation of the immune system underlies the pathogenesis of COVID-19, with inflammation mediated tissue injury to the lung in the setting of suppressed systemic immune function. To define the molecular mechanisms of immune dysfunction in COVID-19 we utilized a systems immunology approach centered on the circulating leukocyte phosphoproteome measured by mass cytometry. We find that although COVID-19 is associated with wholesale activation of a broad set of signaling pathways across myeloid and lymphoid cell populations, STAT3 phosphorylation predominated in both monocytes and T cells. STAT3 phosphorylation was tightly correlated with circulating IL-6 levels and high levels of phospho-STAT3 was associated with decreased markers of myeloid cell maturation/activation and decreased ex-vivo T cell IFN-γ production, demonstrating that during COVID-19 dysregulated cellular activation is associated with suppression of immune effector cell function. Collectively, these data reconcile the systemic inflammatory response and functional immunosuppression induced by COVID-19 and suggest STAT3 signaling may be the central pathophysiologic mechanism driving immune dysfunction in COVID-19."

We used mass cytometry (CyTOF) to profile blood from 86 humans in response to 15 ex vivo immune stimuli. We present reference ranges for cell-specific immune markers and highlight differences that appear across sex and age. We identified modules of immune features that suggest there exists an underlying structure to the immune system based on signaling pathway responses across cell types. We observed increased MAPK signaling in inflammatory pathways in innate immune cells and greater overall coordination of immune cell responses in females. In contrast, males exhibited stronger pSTAT1 and pTBK1 responses. These reference data are publicly available as a resource for immune profiling studies."

One such therapy, alemtuzumab, is thought to reset the immune system without the need for ongoing therapy in a proportion of patients. The exact cells contributing to disease pathogenesis and quiescence remain to be identified. We utilized mass cytometry to analyze B cells from the blood of patients with relapse-remitting MS (RRMS) before and after alemtuzumab treatment, and during relapse. A complementary RRMS cohort was analyzed by single-cell RNA sequencing. The R package ""Spectre"" was used to analyze these data, incorporating FlowSOM clustering, sparse partial least squares-discriminant analysis and permutational multivariate analysis of variance. Immunoglobulin (Ig)A+ and IgG1 + B-cell numbers were altered, including higher IgG1 + B cells during relapse. B-cell linker protein (BLNK), CD40 and CD210 expression by B cells was lower in patients with RRMS compared with non-MS controls, with similar results at the transcriptomic level. Finally, alemtuzumab restored BLNK, CD40 and CD210 expression by IgA+ and IgG1 + B cells, which was altered again during relapse. These data suggest that impairment of IgA+ and IgG1 + B cells may contribute to MS pathogenesis, which can be restored by alemtuzumab."

Here we describe the synthesis and characterization of a new type of metal-chelating polymer with pendant dipicolylamine chelators suited to binding intermediate to soft metals such as rhenium and platinum. We introduce two different conjugation strategies, a thiol-maleimide reaction that works well for rhenium, and a DBCO-azide click reaction designed to avoid potential complications of Pt and other heavy metals interacting with thiol groups. We show that these polymers can serve as new elemental mass tags for mass cytometry. Antibody-polymer conjugates of CD20 and CD8a prepared by both coupling reactions were employed in conjunction with commercial metal-conjugated antibodies for multi-parameter single-cell immunoassays."

Early-stage disease is characterized by superficial infiltrates of small- to medium-sized atypical epidermotropic T lymphocytes that are clonal related. Nevertheless, the percentage of atypical T cells is low with many admixed reactive immune cells. Despite earlier studies, the composition and spatial characteristics of the cutaneous lymphocytic infiltrate has been incompletely characterized. Here, we applied mass cytometry to profile the immune system in skin biopsies of patients with early-stage MF and in normal skin from healthy individuals. Single-cell suspensions were prepared and labeled with a 43-antibody panel, and data were acquired on a Helios mass cytometer. Unbiased hierarchical clustering of the data identified the major immune lineages and heterogeneity therein. This revealed patient-unique cell clusters in both the CD4+ and myeloid cell compartments but also phenotypically distinct cell clusters that were shared by most patients. To characterize the immune compartment in the tissue context, we developed a 36-antibody panel and performed imaging mass cytometry on MF skin tissue. This visualized the structure of MF skin and the distribution of CD4+ T cells, regulatory T cells, CD8+ T cells, malignant T cells, and various myeloid cell subsets. We observed clusters of CD4+ T cells and multiple types of dendritic cells (DCs) identified through differential expression of CD11c, CD1a, and CD1c in the dermis. These results indicated substantial heterogeneity in the composition of the local immune infiltrate but suggest a prominent role for clustered CD4-DC interactions in disease pathogenesis. Probably, the local inhibition of such interactions may constitute an efficient treatment modality."

Traditional manual gating utilized to identify new cell populations has been inadequate, inefficient, unreliable, and difficult to use, and no algorithms to identify both calibration and new cell populations has been well established. A deep learning with graphic cluster (DGCyTOF) visualization is developed as a new integrated embedding visualization approach in identifying canonical and new cell types. The DGCyTOF combines deep-learning classification and hierarchical stable-clustering methods to sequentially build a tri-layer construct for known cell types and the identification of new cell types. First, deep classification learning is constructed to distinguish calibration cell populations from all cells by softmax classification assignment under a probability threshold, and graph embedding clustering is then used to identify new cell populations sequentially. In the middle of two-layer, cell labels are automatically adjusted between new and unknown cell populations via a feedback loop using an iteration calibration system to reduce the rate of error in the identification of cell types, and a 3-dimensional (3D) visualization platform is finally developed to display the cell clusters with all cell-population types annotated. Utilizing two benchmark CyTOF databases comprising up to 43 million cells, we compared accuracy and speed in the identification of cell types among DGCyTOF, DeepCyTOF, and other technologies including dimension reduction with clustering, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis (FA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Isometric Feature Mapping (Isomap), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) with k-means clustering and Gaussian mixture clustering. We observed the DGCyTOF represents a robust complete learning system with high accuracy, speed and visualization by eight measurement criteria. The DGCyTOF displayed F-scores of 0.9921 for CyTOF1 and 0.9992 for CyTOF2 datasets, whereas those scores were only 0.507 and 0.529 for the t-SNE+k-means; 0.565 and 0.59, for UMAP+ k-means. Comparison of DGCyTOF with t-SNE and UMAP visualization in accuracy demonstrated its approximately 35% superiority in predicting cell types. In addition, observation of cell-population distribution was more intuitive in the 3D visualization in DGCyTOF than t-SNE and UMAP visualization. The DGCyTOF model can automatically assign known labels to single cells with high accuracy using deep-learning classification assembling with traditional graph-clustering and dimension-reduction strategies. Guided by a calibration system, the model seeks optimal accuracy balance among calibration cell populations and unknown cell types, yielding a complete and robust learning system that is highly accurate in the identification of cell populations compared to results using other methods in the analysis of single-cell CyTOF data. Application of the DGCyTOF method to identify cell populations could be extended to the analysis of single-cell RNASeq data and other omics data."

However, the therapeutic efficacy of oncolytic viruses against malignant ascites has rarely been explored. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunomodulatory effect of an intraperitoneal injection of human type 5 recombinant adenovirus (called H101) against malignant ascites. Forty patients with malignant ascites were recruited and treated with intraperitoneal H101 in the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. The 4-week clinical responses were determined by an objective assessment of ascites volume change. The ascites response rate and ascites control rate were 40% (16/40) and 75% (30/40), respectively. The major adverse events following intraperitoneal H101 administration were mild-to-moderate abdominal pain (8/40, 20.0%) and fever (11/40, 27.5%); no grade III/IV adverse events were observed. Mass cytometry and immunocytological analysis at baseline, and days 7 and 14 post-treatment showed that intraperitoneally injected H101 led to marked tumor cell depletion, increased dendritic cell and CD8+ T cell densities. H101-meditated tumor-specific immune activation on day 14 post-treatment was further identified by enzyme-linked immunospot assay. In conclusion, intraperitoneal H101 administration was well tolerated and effective in treating malignant ascites; thus, its immune activation ability may be a promising tool in combination with immunotherapy."

The T-cell phenotypes of treated TB patients were prospectively characterized in a blinded fashion using mass cytometry after Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) antigen stimulation with QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus, and then correlated to sputum culture status. At two months of treatment, cytotoxic and terminally differentiated CD8+ T-cells were under-represented and naïve CD4+ T-cells were over-represented in positive- versus negative-sputum culture patients, regardless of Mtb drug susceptibility. At treatment completion, a T-cell immune shift towards differentiated subpopulations was associated with TB cure.

Inflammation is increasingly recognized as a key contributor to the pathophysiology of HF. Heterogeneity and lack of data on the immune mechanism(s) contributing to HF may partially underlie the failure of clinical trials targeting inflammatory mediators. We studied the Immunome in HF cohort using mass cytometry and used data-driven systems immunology approach to discover and characterize modulated immune cell subsets from peripheral blood. We showed cytotoxic and inflammatory innate lymphoid and myeloid cells were expanded in HF patients compared to healthy controls. Network analysis showed highly modular and centralized immune cell architecture in healthy control immune cell network. In contrast, the HF immune cell network showed greater inter-cellular communication and less modular structure.

While myositis specific autoantibodies are well described, we postulate that broader immune endotypes exist in IIM spanning B cell, T cell, and monocyte compartments. This study aims to identify immune endotypes through detailed immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in IIM patients compared to healthy controls. We collected PBMCs from 17 patients with a clinical diagnosis of inflammatory myositis and characterized the B, T, and myeloid cell subsets using mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF). Data were analyzed using a combination of the dimensionality reduction algorithm t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), cluster identification, characterization, and regression (CITRUS), and marker enrichment modeling (MEM); supervised biaxial gating validated populations identified by these methods to be differentially abundant between groups. Using these approaches, we identified shared immunologic features across all IIM patients, despite different clinical features, as well as two distinct immune endotypes. All IIM patients had decreased surface expression of RP105/CD180 on B cells and a reduction in circulating CD3+CXCR3+ subsets relative to healthy controls. One IIM endotype featured CXCR4 upregulation across all cellular compartments. The second endotype was hallmarked by an increased frequency of CD19+CD21loCD11c+ and CD3+CD4+PD1+ subsets.

In particular, toll-like receptor (TLR) expression and signaling are enhanced in MDS, and their inhibition is an attractive therapeutic strategy. Although prior studies have reported increased expression of TLR2 and its binding partners TLR1 and TLR6 in the CD34+ cells of patients with MDS (especially those with low-risk disease), TLR expression in other cell types throughout the bone marrow is largely unknown. To address this, we used mass cytometry to assess the expression of TLR1, TLR2, and TLR6 and cytokines in the bone marrow hematopoietic cells of six low/intermediate-risk and six high-risk unmatched MDS bone marrow samples, as well as healthy controls, both at baseline and in response to TLR agonists. We observed several consistent differences between the groups. Most notably, TLR expression was upregulated in multiple cell populations in the low/intermediate-risk, but not high-risk, patients. In addition, many cytokines, including interleukin-6, interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor α, transforming growth factor β, macrophage inflammatory protein 1β, and granzyme B, were highly expressed from various cell types in low/intermediate-risk patients. However, these same cytokines, with the exception of transforming growth factor β, were expressed at lower levels in high-risk MDS. Together, these findings highlight the differential role of inflammation, and specifically TLR expression, in low/intermediate- versus high-risk MDS, and suggest that elevated TLR expression and cytokine production in multiple cell types likely influences the pathogenesis of MDS in lower-risk patients."

To properly study this interplay, quantifying spatial relationships of multiple cell types within the tumor microenvironment is crucial. To address this, we used cytometry time-of-flight (CyTOF) imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to simultaneously quantify the expression of 35 protein markers, characterizing the microenvironment of 5 benign nevi and 67 melanomas. We profiled more than 220,000 individual cells to identify melanoma, lymphocyte subsets, macrophage/monocyte, and stromal cell populations, allowing for in-depth spatial quantification of the melanoma microenvironment. We found that within pretreatment melanomas, the abundance of proliferating antigen-experienced cytotoxic T cells (CD8+CD45RO+Ki67+) and the proximity of antigen-experienced cytotoxic T cells to melanoma cells were associated with positive response to ICIs.

Immune cell trafficking into tumors is mediated by binding of specific immune cell receptors to chemokines, a class of secreted chemotactic cytokines. To broadly characterize chemokine expression and function in melanoma, we used multiplexed mass cytometry-based imaging of protein markers and RNA transcripts to analyze the chemokine landscape and immune infiltration in metastatic melanoma samples. Tumors that lacked immune infiltration were devoid of most of the profiled chemokines and exhibited low levels of antigen presentation and markers of inflammation. Infiltrated tumors were characterized by expression of multiple chemokines. CXCL9 and CXCL10 were often localized in patches associated with dysfunctional T cells expressing the B lymphocyte chemoattractant CXCL13. In tumors with B cells but no B cell follicles, T cells were the sole source of CXCL13, suggesting that T cells play a role in B cell recruitment and potentially in B cell follicle formation. B cell patches and follicles were also enriched with TCF7+ naïve-like T cells, a cell type that is predictive of response to immune checkpoint blockade. Our data highlight the strength of targeted RNA and protein codetection to analyze tumor immune microenvironments based on chemokine expression and suggest that the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures may be accompanied by naïve and naïve-like T cell recruitment, which may contribute to antitumor activity."

However, they are unsurprisingly imperfect reflections of humans, and the extent and nature of many immunological differences are unknown. With the rise of targeted and biological therapeutics, it is increasingly important that we understand the molecular differences in the immunological behavior of humans and model organisms. However, very few antibodies are raised against non-human primate antigens, and databases of cross-reactivity between species are incomplete. Thus, we screened 332 antibodies in five immune cell populations in blood from humans and four non-human primate species generating a comprehensive cross-reactivity catalog that includes cell type-specificity. We used this catalog to create large mass cytometry universal cross-species phenotyping and signaling panels for humans, along with three of the model organisms most similar to humans: rhesus and cynomolgus macaques and African green monkeys; and one of the mammalian models most widely used in drug development: C57BL/6 mice. As a proof-of-principle, we measured immune cell signaling responses across all five species to an array of 15 stimuli using mass cytometry. We found numerous instances of different cellular phenotypes and immune signaling events occurring within and between species, and detailed three examples (double-positive T cell frequency and signaling; granulocyte response to Bacillus anthracis antigen; and B cell subsets). We also explore the correlation of herpes simian B virus serostatus on the immune profile. Antibody panels and the full dataset generated are available online as a resource to enable future studies comparing immune responses across species during the evaluation of therapeutics."

Natural killer (NK) cell-based therapy is a promising modality to treat post-HCT relapse.MethodsWe initiated this ongoing phase I trial of adoptively transferred cytokine-induced memory-like (CIML) NK cells in patients with myeloid malignancies who relapsed after haploidentical HCT. All patients received a donor-derived NK cell dose of 5 to 10 million cells/kg after lymphodepleting chemotherapy, followed by systemic IL-2 for 7 doses. High-resolution profiling with mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing characterized the expanding and persistent NK cell subpopulations in a longitudinal manner after infusion.ResultsIn the first 6 enrolled patients on the trial, infusion of CIML NK cells led to a rapid 10- to 50-fold in vivo expansion that was sustained over months. The infusion was well tolerated, with fever and pancytopenia as the most common adverse events. Expansion of NK cells was distinct from IL-2 effects on endogenous post-HCT NK cells, and not dependent on CMV viremia. Immunophenotypic and transcriptional profiling revealed a dynamic evolution of the activated CIML NK cell phenotype, superimposed on the natural variation in donor NK cell repertoires.ConclusionGiven their rapid expansion and long-term persistence in an immune-compatible environment, CIML NK cells serve as a promising platform for the treatment of posttransplant relapse of myeloid disease.

However, a comprehensive understanding of their effects on biological systems, especially immunomodulatory responses involving various immune cell types and biomolecules (e.g., cytokines and chemokines), is still incomplete. In this study, a single-cell-based, high-dimensional mass cytometry approach is used to investigate the immunomodulatory responses of Ag NPs using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) exposed to poly-vinyl-pyrrolidone (PVP)-coated Ag NPs of different core sizes (i.e., 10-, 20-, and 40-nm). Although there were no severe cytotoxic effects observed, PVPAg10 and PVPAg20 were excessively found in monocytes and dendritic cells, while PVPAg40 displayed more affinity with B cells and natural killer cells, thereby triggering the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-17A, IL-17F, MIP1β, TNFα, and IFNγ. Our findings indicate that under the exposure conditions tested in this study, Ag NPs only triggered the inflammatory responses in a size-dependent manner rather than induce cytotoxicity in hPBMCs. Our study provides an appropriate ex vivo model to better understand the human immune responses against Ag NP at a single-cell level, which can contribute to the development of targeted drug delivery, vaccine developments, and cancer radiotherapy treatments."

More than two thirds of licensed NK cells (i.e., those expressing Ly49C, Ly49I, or both) in uninfected mice had already differentiated into NK cells with phenotypes indicative of Ag encounter (KLRG1+Ly6C-) or memory-like status (KLRG1+Ly6C+). These pre-existing KLRG1+Ly6C+ NK cells resembled known Ag-specific memory NK cell populations in being less responsive to IL-18 and IFN-α stimulation in vitro and by selecting for NK cell clones with elevated expression of a Ly49 receptor. During MCMV infection, the significant differences between licensed and unlicensed (Ly49C-Ly49I-) NK cells disappeared within both CMV-specific (Ly49H+) and nonspecific (Ly49H-) responses. This lack of heterogeneity carried into the memory phase, with only a difference in CD16 expression manifesting between licensed and unlicensed MCMV-specific memory NK cell populations. Our results suggest that restricting proliferation is the predominant effect licensing has on the NK cell population during MCMV infection, but the inhibitory Ly49-MHC interactions that take place ahead of infection contribute to their limited expansion by shrinking the pool of licensed NK cells capable of robustly responding to new challenges."

Individual heterogeneity and variable disease resolution timelines obscure unifying immune characteristics. Here, we collected and profiled >200 longitudinal peripheral blood samples from patients hospitalized with COVID-19, with other respiratory infections, and healthy individuals, using mass cytometry to measure immune cells and signaling states at single cell resolution. COVID-19 patients showed a unique immune composition and an early, coordinated and elevated immune cell signaling profile, which correlated with early hospital discharge. Intra-patient time course analysis tied to clinically relevant events of recovery revealed a conserved set of immunological processes that accompany, and are unique to, disease resolution and discharge. This immunological process, together with additional changes in CD4 regulatory T cells and basophils, accompanies recovery from respiratory failure and is associated with better clinical outcomes at the time of admission. Our work elucidates the biological timeline of immune recovery from COVID-19 and provides insights into the fundamental processes of COVID-19 resolution in hospitalized patients."

Current standard techniques such as immunohistochemical staining and immunofluorescence staining are limited for their multiplicity. Simultaneously visualizing detailed cell subtypes and bacteria distribution across the same pathological section remains a major technical challenge. Herein, we developed a rapid semi-quantitative method for in situ imaging of bacteria and multiplex cell phenotypes on the same solid tumor tissue sections. We designed a panel of antibody probes labeled with mass tags, namely prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell hybrid probes for in situ imaging (PEHPSI). For application demonstration, PEHPSI stained two bacteria subtypes (lipopolysaccharides (LPS) for Gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) for Gram-positive bacteria) simultaneously with four types of immune cells (leukocytes, CD8 + T-cells, B-cells and macrophages) and four breast cancer subtypes (classified by a panel of 12 human proteins) on the same tissue section. We unveiled that breast cancer cells are commonly enriched with Gram-negative bacteria and almost absent of Gram-positive bacteria, regardless of the cancer subtypes (triple-negative breast cancer [TNBC], HER2+, Luminal A and Luminal B). Further analysis revealed that on the single-cell level, Gram-negative bacteria have a significant correlation with CD8 + T-cells only in HER2+ breast cancer, while PKCD, ER, PR and Ki67 are correlated with Gram-negative bacteria in the other three subtypes of breast cancers. On the cell population level, in TNBC, CD19 expression intensity is up-regulated by approximately 25% in bacteria-enriched cells, while for HER2+, Luminal A and Luminal B breast cancers, the intensity of biomarkers associated with the malignancy, metastasis and proliferation of cancer cells (PKCD, ISG15 and IFI6) is down-regulated by 29%-38%. The flexible and expandable PEHPSI system permits intuitive multiplex co-visualization of bacteria and mammalian cells, which facilitates future research on tumor microbiome and tumor pathogenesis."

We use the term diversity to capture intrasubject platelet variability that can be intrinsic or governed by the environment and lead to a heterogeneous response pattern of aggregation, clot promotion, and external communication. Using choice examples, we discuss how the use of advanced technologies can provide new insights into the underlying causes of platelet molecular, structural, and functional diversity. As sources of diversity, we discuss the proliferating megakaryocytes with different allele-specific expression patterns, the asymmetrical formation of proplatelets, changes in platelets induced by aging and priming, interplatelet heterogeneity in thrombus organization and stability, and platelet-dependent communications. We provide indications how current knowledge gaps can be addressed using promising technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, proteomic approaches, advanced imaging techniques, multicolor flow and mass cytometry, multifunctional microfluidics assays, and organ-on-a-chip platforms. We then argue how this technology base can aid in characterizing platelet populations and in identifying platelet biomarkers relevant for the treatment of cardiovascular disease."

Here we used label-free mass cytometry (CyESI-MS) as a new tool to analyze the metabolites in Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HepG2) cells at the single-cell level after the interaction with different numbers of NK92 MI cells. A large amount of chemical information from individual HepG2 cells was obtained showing the process of cell apoptosis induced by NK cells. Nineteen metabolites which consecutively change during cell apoptosis were revealed by calculating their average relative intensity. Four metabolic pathways were impacted during cell apoptosis which hit 4 metabolites including glutathione (GSH), creatine, glutamic acid and taurine. We found that the HepG2 cells could be divided into two phenotypes after co-culturing with NK cells according to the bimodal distribution of concentration of these 4 metabolites. The correlation between metabolites and different apoptotic pathways in the early apoptosis cell group was established by the 4 metabolites at the single-cell level.

It remains unclear how the immune system participates in the cytoprotective function of HO-1 in the context of atherosclerosis. In this study, we attempted to investigate the potential effect of a HO-1 inducer, hemin, and a HO-1 inhibitor, Tin-protoporphyrin IX (SnPP), on the progression of atherosclerosis in ApoE deficient mice. Using mass cytometry, 15 immune cell populations and 29 T cell sub-clusters in spleen and peripheral blood were thoroughly analyzed after hemin or SnPP treatment. SnPP elevated risk factors of atherosclerosis, whereas hemin reduced them. In-depth analysis showed that hemin significantly modified the immune system in both spleen and peripheral blood. Hemin increased dendritic (DC) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), but decreased natural killer (NK) cells. An opposite effect was observed with SnPP treatment in terms of NK cells. NK cells and MDSCs were positively and negatively correlated with total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein, respectively. Moreover, the T cell profiles were significantly reshaped by hemin, whereas only minor changes were observed with SnPP. Several hemin-modulated T cell clusters associated with atherosclerosis were also identified. In summary, we have unraveled an important regulatory role for HO-1 pathway in immune cell regulation and atherosclerosis. Our finding suggests that modulating HO-1 signaling represents a potential therapeutic strategy against atherosclerosis."

There is little data showing the spatio-temporal behavior of nanomedicines in tissues as current methods are not able to provide a comprehensive view of the nanomedicine distribution, released drug or its effects in the context of a complex tissue microenvironment. Methods: A new experimental approach which integrates the molecular imaging and bioanalytical technologies MSI and IMC was developed to determine the biodistribution of total drug and drug metabolite delivered via PLA-PEG nanoparticles and to overlay this with imaging of the nanomedicine in the context of detailed tumor microenvironment markers. This was used to assess the nanomedicine AZD2811 in animals bearing three different pre-clinical PDX tumors. Results: This new approach delivered new insights into the nanoparticle/drug biodistribution. Mass spectrometry imaging was able to differentiate the tumor distribution of co-dosed deuterated non-nanoparticle-formulated free drug alongside the nanoparticle-formulated drug by directly visualizing both delivery approaches within the same animal or tissue. While the IV delivered free drug was uniformly distributed, the nanomedicine delivered drug was heterogeneous. By staining for multiple biomarkers of the tumor microenvironment on the same tumor sections using imaging mass cytometry, co-registering and integrating data from both imaging modalities it was possible to determine the features in regions with highest nanomedicine distribution. Nanomedicine delivered drug was associated with regions higher in macrophages, as well as more stromal regions of the tumor. Such a comparison of complementary molecular data allows delineation of drug abundance in individual cell types and in stroma. Conclusions: This multi-modal imaging solution offers researchers a better understanding of drug and nanocarrier distribution in complex tissues and enables data-driven drug carrier design."

Here, we show that in secondary immune reactions to the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, CD4+ TRM are mobilized into the blood within 16 to 48 h after immunization in humans. This mobilization of TRM is cognate: TRM recognizing other antigens are not mobilized, unless they cross-react with the vaccine. We also demonstrate through methylome analyses that TRM are mobilized from the Bm. These mobilized cells make significant contribution to the systemic immune reaction, as evidenced by their T-cell receptor Vβ clonotypes represented among the newly generated circulating memory T-cells, 14 days after vaccination. Thus, TRM of the Bm confer not only local, but also systemic immune memory."

Systemic reactogenicity, a manifestation of the innate immune response to vaccines, occurs in up to 69% of patients following vaccination with RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. Tumor regression can occur following an intense immune-inflammatory response and novel strategies to treat cancer rely on manipulating the host immune system. Here, we report spontaneous regression of metastatic salivary gland myoepithelial carcinoma in a patient who experienced grade 3 systemic reactogenicity, following vaccination with the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine. Histological and immunophenotypic inspection of the postvaccination lung biopsy specimens showed a massive inflammatory infiltrate with scant embedded tumor clusters (<5%). Highly multiplexed imaging mass cytometry showed that the postvaccination lung metastasis samples had remarkable immune cell infiltration, including CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells, B cells, and dendritic cells, which contrasted with very low levels of these cells in the prevaccination primary tumor and lung metastasis samples. CT scans obtained 3, 6, and 9 months after the second vaccine dose demonstrated persistent tumor shrinkage (50%, 67%, and 73% reduction, respectively), suggesting that vaccination stimulated anticancer immunity. Insight: This case suggests that the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine stimulated anticancer immunity and tumor regression."

Epub 2022 Mar 1.,Article has no keywords,"Silica coating of inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) is widely employed as a means of providing colloidal stability in aqueous media and surface functionality for a variety of applications, particularly in biology. When the NPs are synthesized with a surface coating of an organic surfactant like oleic acid, silica coating is performed by using the reverse microemulsion method. There are many reports in the literature of the successful application of this method to NaYF4 upconversion NPs (doped with Yb and Er), and we have used this method to coat NaHoF4 NPs designed as a mass cytometry reagent. This method failed when we attempted to apply it to other NaLnF4 NPs (Ln = Sm, Eu, Tb). In this report we describe an investigation of the problem and show how it can be overcome. To control size in the synthesis of NaLnF4 NPs and at the same time maintain size uniformity, it is necessary to adjust the Na/F and F/Ln ratios. Problems with silica coating are associated with substoichiometric F/Ln ratios (F/Ln < 4) that leave Ln oleate salts as a byproduct, often as a phase-separated oily layer that could not be purified from the NPs by precipitation with ethanol and redispersion in hexanes. The nature of the oily byproduct was inferred from a combination of TGA, NMR, and FTIR measurements. We explored five different additional purification procedures, and by adopting the appropriate purification method, NaLnF4 NPs with a variety of compositions and synthesized using different reaction conditions could be coated with a thin shell of silica."

Natural Killer (NK) cells are innate immune cells that play a critical role in controlling viral infections and have been shown to be involved in preventing HIV-1 infection and, in those who are infected, delaying time to progression to AIDS. However, their role in limiting HIV-1 persistence on long term ART is still uncharacterized. To identify associations between markers of HIV-1 persistence and the NK cell receptor-ligand repertoire, we used twin mass cytometry panels to characterize the peripheral blood NK receptor-ligand repertoire in individuals with long-term antiretroviral suppression enrolled in the AIDS Clinical Trial Group A5321 study. At the time of testing, participants had been on ART for a median of 7 years, with virological suppression <50 copies/mL since at most 48 weeks on ART. We found that the NK cell receptor and ligand repertoires did not change across three longitudinal samples over one year-a median of 25 weeks and 50 weeks after the initial sampling. To determine the features of the receptor-ligand repertoire that associate with markers of HIV-1 persistence, we performed a LASSO normalized regression. This analysis revealed that the NK cell ligands CD58, HLA-B, and CRACC, as well as the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) KIR2DL1, KIR2DL3, and KIR2DS4 were robustly predictive of markers of HIV-1 persistence, as measured by total HIV-1 cell-associated DNA, HIV-1 cell-associated RNA, and single copy HIV-RNA assays. To characterize the roles of cell populations defined by multiple markers, we augmented the LASSO analysis with FlowSOM clustering. This analysis found that a less mature NK cell phenotype (CD16+CD56dimCD57-LILRB1-NKG2C-) was associated with lower HIV-1 cell associated DNA. Finally, we found that surface expression of HLA-Bw6 measured by CyTOF was associated with lower HIV-1 persistence. Genetic analysis revealed that this was driven by lower HIV-1 persistence in HLA-Bw4/6 heterozygotes. These findings suggest that there may be a role for NK cells in controlling HIV-1 persistence in individuals on long-term ART, which must be corroborated by future studies."

Here, we adapted mass cytometry to simultaneously analyze trafficking and functional proteins expression in CD19 CAR T cells across patients' tissues, including leukapheresis T cells, CAR product, CAR T cells in peripheral blood, bone marrow, and cerebrospinal fluid post infusion and correlate them with phenotypes. This approach revealed spatiotemporal plasticity of CAR T cells. Patients' CAR product revealed upregulation in many trafficking and activation molecules compared to leukapheresis T cells as baseline. Including statistically significant upregulation in CD4 and CD8 integrin-β7, CD4 granzyme B, and CD11a as well as CD8 CD25 and CD95. Moreover, patients' tissues showed spatiotemporal alteration in trafficking, activation, maturation, and exhaustion features, with a distinct signature in the central nervous system niche. Compared to peripheral blood samples, cerebrospinal fluid samples were statistically significant enriched in CD4 and CD8 trafficking and memory phenotype proteins integrin β7, CCR7, CXCR4, and CD8 CD69.

Hepatic fibrosis, one of the most common liver diseases diagnosed in many developed countries, occurs in response to chronic liver injury and is primarily driven by the development of inflammation. Earlier immunological studies have been focused on the importance of the innate immune response in the pathophysiology of steatohepatitis and fibrosis, but recently, it has also been reported that adaptive immunity, particularly B cells, plays an essential role in hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. However, despite recent data showing the importance of adaptive immunity, relatively little is known about the role of B cells in the pathogenesis of steatohepatitis fibrosis. In this study, a single-cell-based, high-dimensional mass cytometric investigation of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from mice belonging to three groups [normal chow (NC), thioacetamide (TAA), and 11beta-HSD inhibitor drug] was conducted to further understand the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis through reliable noninvasive biomarkers. Firstly, major immune cell types and their population changes were qualitatively analyzed using UMAP dimensionality reduction and two-dimensional visualization technique combined with a conventional manual gating strategy. The population of B cells displayed a twofold increase in the TAA group compared to that in the NC group, which was recovered slightly after treatment with the 11beta-HSD inhibitor drug. In contrast, the populations of NK cells, effector CD4+ T cells, and memory CD8+ T cells were significantly reduced in the TAA group compared with those in the NC group. Further identification and quantification of the major immune cell types and their subsets were conducted based on automated clustering approaches [PhenoGraph (PG) and FlowSOM]. The B-cell subset corresponding to PhenoGraph cluster PG#2 (CD62LhighCD44highLy6chigh B cells) and PG#3 (CD62LhighCD44highLy6clow B cell) appears to play a major role in both the development of hepatic fibrosis and recovery via treatment, whereas PG#1 (CD62LlowCD44highLy6clow B cell) seems to play a dominant role in the development of hepatic fibrosis. These findings provide insights into the roles of cellular subsets of B cells during the progression of, and recovery from, hepatic fibrosis."

We report here a multiomics investigation of systemic IFN signaling in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, defining the multiomics biosignatures associated with varying levels of 12 different type I, II, and III IFNs. The antiviral transcriptional response in circulating immune cells is strongly associated with a specific subset of IFNs, most prominently IFNA2 and IFNG. In contrast, proteomics signatures indicative of endothelial damage and platelet activation associate with high levels of IFNB1 and IFNA6. Seroconversion and time since hospitalization associate with a significant decrease in a specific subset of IFNs. Additionally, differential IFN subtype production is linked to distinct constellations of circulating myeloid and lymphoid immune cell types. Each IFN has a unique metabolic signature, with IFNG being the most associated with activation of the kynurenine pathway. IFNs also show differential relationships with clinical markers of poor prognosis and disease severity. For example, whereas IFNG has the strongest association with C-reactive protein and other immune markers of poor prognosis, IFNB1 associates with increased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, a marker of late severe disease. Altogether, these results reveal specialized IFN action in COVID-19, with potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications."

We present NaroNet, a deep learning framework that models the multi-scale tumor microenvironment from multiplex-stained cancer tissue images and provides patient-level interpretable predictions using a seamless end-to-end learning pipeline. Trained only with multiplex-stained tissue images and their corresponding patient-level clinical labels, NaroNet unsupervisedly learns which cell phenotypes, cell neighborhoods, and neighborhood interactions have the highest influence to predict the correct label. To this end, NaroNet incorporates several novel and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, such as patch-level contrastive learning, multi-level graph embeddings, a novel max-sum pooling operation, or a metric that quantifies the relevance that each microenvironment element has in the individual predictions. We validate NaroNet using synthetic data simulating multiplex-immunostained images where a patient label is artificially associated to the -adjustable- probabilistic incidence of different microenvironment elements. We then apply our model to two sets of images of human cancer tissues: 336 seven-color multiplex-immunostained images from 12 high-grade endometrial cancer patients; and 382 35-plex mass cytometry images from 215 breast cancer patients. In both synthetic and real datasets, NaroNet provides outstanding predictions of relevant clinical information while associating those predictions to the presence of specific microenvironment elements."

Epub 2022 Feb 19.,Keywords: Aging; Imaging mass cytometry; Mitochondria; Osteoporosis; Respiratory chain defect.,"Osteoporosis is a skeletal disease which is characterised by reduced bone mass and microarchitecture, with a subsequent loss of strength that predisposes to fragility and risk of fractures. The pathogenesis of falling bone mineral density, ultimately leading to a diagnosis of osteoporosis is incompletely understood but the disease is currently thought to be multifactorial. Humans are known to accumulate mitochondrial mutations and respiratory chain deficiency with age and mounting evidence suggests that this may indeed be the overarching cause intrinsic to the changing phenotype in advancing age and age-related disease. Mitochondrial mutations are detectable from the age of about 30 years onwards. Mitochondria contain their own genome which encodes 13 essential mitochondrial proteins and accumulates somatic variants at up to 10 times the rate of the nuclear genome. Once the concentration of any pathogenic mitochondrial genome variant exceeds a threshold, respiratory chain deficiency and cellular dysfunction occur. The PolgD257A/D257A mouse model is a knock-in mutant that expresses a proof-reading-deficient version of PolgA, a nuclear encoded subunit of mtDNA polymerase. These mice are a useful model of age-related accumulation of mtDNA mutations in humans since their defective proof-reading mechanism leads to a mitochondrial DNA mutation rate 3-5 times higher than in wild-type mice. These mice showed enhanced levels of age-related osteoporosis along with respiratory chain deficiency in osteoblasts. To explore whether respiratory chain deficiency is also seen in human osteoblasts, we developed a protocol and analysis framework for imaging mass cytometry in bone tissue sections to analyse osteoblasts in situ. By comparing bone tissue sampled at one timepoint from femoral neck of 10 older healthy volunteers aged 40-85 with samples from young patients aged 1-19, we have identified complex I defect in osteoblasts from 6 out of 10 older volunteers, complex II defect in 2 out of 10 older volunteers, complex IV defect in 1 out of 10 older volunteers and complex V defect in 4 out of 10 older volunteers. These observations are consistent with findings from the PolgD257A/D257A mouse model and suggest that respiratory chain deficiency, as a consequence of the accumulation of age-related pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutations, may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of human age-related osteoporosis."

Here, we investigate IFN signaling in SLE using multiplexed protein arrays and single cell cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF). First, the IFN signature for SLE patients (n=81) from the Stanford Lupus Registry is determined using fluidigm qPCR measuring 44 previously determined IFN-inducible transcripts. IFN-high (IFN-H) patients have increased SLE criteria and renal/CNS/immunologic involvement, and increased autoantibody reactivity against spliceosome-associated antigens. CyTOF analysis is performed on non-stimulated and stimulated (IFNα, IFNγ, IL-21) PBMCs from SLE patients (n=25) and HCs (n=9) in a panel identifying changes in phosphorylation of intracellular signaling proteins (pTOF). Another panel is utilized to detect changes in intracellular cytokine (ICTOF) production in non-stimulated and stimulated (PMA/ionomycin) PBMCs from SLE patients (n=31) and HCs (n=17). Bioinformatic analysis by MetaCyto and OMIQ reveal phenotypic changes in immune cell subsets between IFN-H and IFN-low (IFN-L) patients. Most notably, IFN-H patients exhibit increased STAT1/3/5 phosphorylation downstream of cytokine stimulation and increased phosphorylation of non-canonical STAT proteins. These results suggest that IFN signaling in SLE modulates STAT phosphorylation, potentially uncovering possible targets for future therapeutic approaches."

However, surgical trauma leads to controlled tissue damage, causing profound alterations in host immunity and, in turn, affecting post-operative outcomes. Surgery-induced immune alterations in CRC remain poorly defined. Here, single-cell mass cytometry was applied to serial blood samples collected pre-operatively, and on days 1, 3, and 7 post-operatively from 24 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgical resection of CRC to comprehensively monitor the perioperative phenotypic alterations in immune cells and dynamics of immune response. Characterization of immune cell subsets revealed that the post-operative immune response is broad but predominantly suppressive, supported by the decreases in total frequencies of circulating T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, as well as decreased HLA-DR expression on circulating monocytes. The proportion of T cells significantly decreased on day 1 and recovered to the pre-surgical level on day 3 after surgery. The frequency of monocytes was significantly elevated on day 1 after surgery and declined to baseline level on day 3. NK cells temporarily contracted on post-operative day 3. T cells, monocytes, DCs, NK cells, and B cells were partitioned into phenotypically different single-cell clusters. The dynamics of single-cell clusters were different from those of the bulk lineages. T cell clusters in the same response phase fluctuate inconsistently during the perioperative period. Comparing to the baseline levels, the frequencies of CD11b(+)CD33(+)CD14(+)CD16(-) classical monocytes expanded followed by contraction, whereas CD11b(+)CD33(+)CD14(high)CD16(low) intermediate monocytes remained unchanged; HLA-DR expression in monocytes were significantly reduced; the frequencies of intermediate CD56(bright)CD16(+) NK cell subsets increased; and the percentage of memory B lymphocytes were elevated after surgery. Post-operative pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were both altered. Furthermore, perioperative immune perturbations in some of the cell subsets were unrecovered within seven days after surgery. Chronological monitoring major immune lineages provided an overview of surgery-caused alterations, including cell augments and contractions and precisely timed changes in immune cell distribution in both innate and adaptive compartments, providing evidence for the interaction between tumor resection and immune modulation."

Memory-like natural killer (NK) cells expressing NKG2C and lacking FcεRIγ are established during CMV infection. Additionally, CD8+ T cells expressing NKG2C have been observed in some CMV-seropositive patients. However, in vivo kinetics detailing the development and differentiation of these lymphocyte subsets during CMV infection remain limited. Here, we interrogated the in vivo kinetics of lymphocytes in CMV-infected renal transplant patients using longitudinal samples compared with those of nonviremic (NV) patients. Recipient CMV-seropositive (R+) patients had preexisting memory-like NK cells (NKG2C+CD57+FcεRIγ-) at baseline, which decreased in the periphery immediately after transplantation in both viremic and NV patients. We identified a subset of prememory-like NK cells (NKG2C+CD57+FcεRIγlow-dim) that increased during viremia in R+ viremic patients. These cells showed a higher cytotoxic profile than preexisting memory-like NK cells with transient up-regulation of FcεRIγ and Ki67 expression at the acute phase, with the subsequent accumulation of new memory-like NK cells at later phases of viremia. Furthermore, cytotoxic NKG2C+CD8+ T cells and γδ T cells significantly increased in viremic patients but not in NV patients. These three different cytotoxic cells combinatorially responded to viremia, showing a relatively early response in R+ viremic patients compared with recipient CMV-seronegative viremic patients. All viremic patients, except one, overcame viremia and did not experience graft rejection. These data provide insights into the in vivo dynamics and interplay of cytotoxic lymphocytes responding to CMV viremia, which are potentially linked with control of CMV viremia to prevent graft rejection."

We show that low-variance controls, such as healthy samples and stable channels, are inherently homogeneous, robust against stimulation, and can serve as generalized anchors for batch correction. Single-cell quantification comparing mass cytometry data from 989 leukemia files pre- and post normalization with CytofIn demonstrates effective batch correction while recapitulating the gold-standard bead normalization. CytofIn integration of public cancer datasets enabled the comparison of immune features across histologies and treatments. We demonstrate the ability to integrate public datasets without necessitating identical control samples or bead standards for fast and robust analysis using CytofIn."

ASC are derived from activated B cells, which may differentiate extrafollicularly or form germinal center (GC) reactions within secondary lymphoid organs. ASC therefore consist of short-lived, poorly matured plasmablasts that generally secrete lower-affinity antibodies, or long-lived, highly matured plasma cells that generally secrete higher-affinity antibodies. The ASC population is responsible for producing an immediate humoral B cell response, the polyclonal antibody repertoire, as well as in parallel building effective humoral memory and immunity, or potentially driving pathology in the case of autoimmunity. ASC are phenotypically and transcriptionally distinct from other B cells and further distinguishable by morphology, varied lifespans, and anatomical localization. Single cell analyses are required to interrogate the functional and transcriptional diversity of ASC and their secreted antibody repertoire and understand the contribution of individual ASC responses to the polyclonal humoral response. Here we summarize the current and emerging functional and molecular techniques for high-throughput characterization of ASC with single cell resolution, including flow and mass cytometry, spot-based and microfluidic-based assays, focusing on functional approaches of the secreted antibodies: specificity, affinity, and secretion rate."

Epub 2022 Feb 15.,Article has no keywords,"Lanthanide nanoparticles (LnNPs) have the potential to be used as high-sensitivity mass tag reporters in mass cytometry immunoassays. For this application, however, the LnNPs must be made colloidally stable in aqueous buffers, demonstrate minimal non-specific binding to cells, and have functional groups to attach antibodies or other targeting agents. One possible approach to address these requirements is by using lipid coating to modify the surface of the LnNPs. In this work, 39 nm diameter NaYF4:Yb, Er NPs (LnNPs) were coated with a lipid formulation consisting of egg sphingomyelin, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane, cholesterol-(polyethylene glycol-600), and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[biotinyl(polyethylene glycol)-2000]. The resulting biotinylated lipid-coated LnNPs were characterized by dynamic light scattering to determine the hydrodynamic size and stability in phosphate buffered saline, and the composition of the lipid coatings was quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The specific and non-specific binding of the biotinylated lipid-coated LnNPs to a model system of functionalized polystyrene microbeads were then tested by both suspension and imaging mass cytometry. We found that targeted binding with minimal non-specific binding can be achieved with the lipid-coated LnNPs and that the lipid composition of the coating has an impact on the performance of the LnNPs as mass cytometry reporters. These results additionally establish the importance of quantifying the composition of lipid-coated nanomaterials to optimize them more effectively for their desired application."

However, little is known about the features of these effector cells from people living with HIV (PLWH), particularly from those who initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) during acute infection. Our study design was to use 42-parameter CyTOF to conduct deep phenotyping of paired blood- and lymph node (LN)-derived T and NK cells from three groups of HIV+ aviremic individuals: elite controllers (N = 5), and ART-suppressed individuals who had started therapy during chronic (N = 6) vs. acute infection (N = 8), the latter of which is associated with better outcomes. We found that acute-treated individuals are enriched for specific subsets of T and NK cells, including blood-derived CD56-CD16+ NK cells previously associated with HIV control, and LN-derived CD4+ T follicular helper cells with heightened expansion potential. An in-depth comparison of the features of the cells from blood vs. LNs of individuals from our cohort revealed that T cells from blood were more activated than those from LNs. By contrast, LNs were enriched for follicle-homing CXCR5+ CD8+ T cells, which expressed increased levels of inhibitory receptors and markers of survival and proliferation as compared to their CXCR5- counterparts. In addition, a subset of memory-like CD56brightTCF1+ NK cells was enriched in LNs relative to blood. These results together suggest unique T and NK cell features in acute-treated individuals, and highlight the importance of examining effector cells not only in blood but also the lymphoid tissue compartment, where the reservoir mostly persists, and where these cells take on distinct phenotypic features."

While the desmoplastic stroma has rendered PDAC resistant to immunotherapies, irreversible electroporation (IRE), a non-thermal method of tumor ablation, can overcome some of this resistance and immune suppression. We studied the systemic immunophenotype of patients following local treatment of PDAC. Stored lymphocytes from peripheral blood collected pre- and post-operatively for patients with PDAC who underwent surgical treatment from 12/2018 until 12/2019 were prepared for mass cytometry and a 30-marker panel identifying 37 immune-cell clusters were analyzed and compared to all clinical parameters. Stored lymphocytes from patient samples were collected pre-operatively postoperatively (Day 1, 3, 5 and 14) and during surveillance (Month 3, 6, 9 and 12). Thirty patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) who underwent IRE were evaluated prospectively for changes in their immunophenotype. No significant differences in baseline demographics or tumor markers were identified. CA19-9 levels were significantly higher among patients who developed a recurrence (P=0.03). In the early perioperative period, CD4 and CD8 central memory cells were significantly higher among patients who did not recur (P=0.02 and 0.009 respectively). These findings were maintained in the late (>3 month) surveillance period. Early natural killer (NK) cells were significantly higher among those who did not recur (P=0.004) in the early postoperative period. The early immune-cell populations of CD4 and CD8 central memory cells and early NK cells were significantly higher among populations who did not recur following IRE for PDAC during the study period, with maintenance of the CD4 and CD8 central memory populations during later surveillance. Monitoring the early immunophenotype may offer opportunities to augment the immune response following tumor-disruptive IRE for PDAC."

However, detection, inhibition, and elimination of EMT-undergoing cells is challenging due to the intrinsic heterogeneity of cancer cells and the phenotypic diversity of EMT programs. We comprehensively profiled EMT transition phenotypes in four non-cancerous human mammary epithelial cell lines using a flow cytometry surface marker screen, RNA sequencing, and mass cytometry. EMT was induced in the HMLE and MCF10A cell lines and in the HMLE-Twist-ER and HMLE-Snail-ER cell lines by prolonged exposure to TGFβ1 or 4-hydroxytamoxifen, respectively. Each cell line exhibited a spectrum of EMT transition phenotypes, which we compared to the steady-state phenotypes of fifteen luminal, HER2-positive, and basal breast cancer cell lines. Our data provide multiparametric insights at single-cell level into the phenotypic diversity of EMT at different time points and in four human cellular models. These insights are valuable to better understand the complexity of EMT, to compare EMT transitions between the cellular models used here, and for the design of EMT time course experiments."

Preclinical studies have shown that obese adipose tissue induces lung neutrophilia associated with enhanced BC metastasis to this site. Here we show that obesity leads to neutrophil-dependent impairment of vascular integrity through loss of endothelial adhesions, enabling cancer cell extravasation into the lung. Mechanistically, neutrophil-produced reactive oxygen species in obese mice increase neutrophil extracellular DNA traps (NETs) and weaken endothelial junctions, facilitating the influx of tumor cells from the peripheral circulation. In vivo treatment with catalase, NET inhibitors or genetic deletion of Nos2 reversed this effect in preclinical models of obesity. Imaging mass cytometry of lung metastasis samples from patients with cancer revealed an enrichment in neutrophils with low catalase levels correlating with elevated body mass index. Our data provide insights into potentially targetable mechanisms that underlie the progression of BC in the obese population."

Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) enables simultaneous detection of up to 40 antigens and transcripts using metal-tagged antibodies but has so far been restricted to two-dimensional imaging. Here we report the development of 3D IMC for multiplexed 3D tissue analysis at single-cell resolution and demonstrate the utility of the technology by analysis of human breast cancer samples. The resulting 3D models reveal cellular and microenvironmental heterogeneity and cell-level tissue organization not detectable in two dimensions. 3D IMC will prove powerful in the study of phenomena occurring in 3D space such as tumor cell invasion and is expected to provide invaluable insights into cellular microenvironments and tissue architecture.

Synaptic changes are also known to be important in neurocognitive disorders such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders. Several labs, including ours, have demonstrated that conventional (fluorescence-based) flow cytometry of individual synaptosomes is a robust and reproducible method. However, the repertoire of probes needed to assess comprehensively the type of synapse, pathologic proteins (including protein products of risk genes discovered in GWAS), and markers of stress and injury far exceeds what is achievable with conventional flow cytometry. We recently developed a method that applies CyTOF (Cytometry by Time-Of-Flight mass spectrometry) to high-dimensional analysis of individual human synaptosomes, overcoming many of the multiplexing limitations of conventional flow cytometry. We call this new method Mass Synaptometry.

Direct administration of autoantigen into lymph nodes has emerged as an alternative administration route that can improve the efficacy of the treatment. In the first open-label clinical trial in humans, injection of aluminum-formulated glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-alum) into an inguinal lymph node led to the promising preservation of C-peptide in patients with recent-onset type 1 diabetes. The treatment induced a distinct immunomodulatory effect, but the response at the cell level has not been fully characterized. Here we used mass cytometry to profile the immune landscape in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 12 participants of the study before and after 15 months of treatment. The immunomodulatory effect of the therapy included reduction of naïve and unswitched memory B cells, increase in follicular helper T cells and expansion of PD-1+ CD69+ cells in both CD8+ and double negative T cells. In vitro stimulation with GAD65 only affected effector CD8+ T cells in samples collected before the treatment. However, the recall response to antigen after 15 months included induction of CXCR3+ and CD11c+Tbet+ B cells, PD-1+ follicular helper T cells and exhausted-like CD8+ T cells. This study provides a deeper insight into the immunological changes associated with GAD-alum administration directly into the lymph nodes."

Constitutive expression by CD4+ T cells of an active form of STAT3, a signal transducer and transcription factor, has been shown to induce many of the major features of PsA in an animal model. We used high dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) to probe ex-vivo levels of phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) in circulating immune cell subpopulations from PsA patients during active and inactive states. We evaluated the frequency of 16 immune cell populations and the levels of the activated forms of STAT3 (pSTAT3) and, for comparison, STAT1 (pSTAT1) and Src (pSrc) in whole blood fixed shortly after collection. In addition to PsA patients, we studied active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Increased levels of pSTAT3 were found in all the CD4+ T cell subsets analyzed, specifically, Th1, Th2, Th17, T follicular helper (Tfh) and T regulatory (Treg) as well as in CD14+CD16- (classical) monocytes from active PsA patients compared to inactive patients. After correcting for body mass index (BMI), smoking and conventional disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (c-DMARDs), levels of pSTAT3 levels remained increased in Th1 and Tfh CD4+ T cells, and in CD14+CD16- monocytes from active patients compared to inactive patients. No differences between the patient groups were observed for pSTAT1 or pSrc. No differences were found between the active PsA and active RA groups after correction for multiple testing. During active PsA, circulating Th1 and Tfh CD4+ T cells, and CD14+CD16- monocytes expressing high levels of pSTAT3 may play a role in PsA pathophysiology, perhaps by migration to inflamed sites."

Normal skin/keloid scar tissue-derived fibroblast genome expression data sets were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and ArrayExpress databases. Hub genes have a high degree of connectivity and gene function aggregation in the integration network. The hub DEGs were screened by gene-related protein-protein interactions (PPIs), and their biological processes and signaling pathways were annotated to identify critical biomarkers. Finally, eighty-one hub DEGs were selected for further analysis, and some noteworthy signaling pathways and genes were found to be closely related to keloid fibrosis. For example, IL17RA is involved in IL-17 signal transduction, TIMP2 and MMP14 activate extracellular matrix metalloproteinases, and TNC, ITGB2, and ITGA4 interact with cell surface integrins. Furthermore, changes in local immune cell activity in keloid tissue were detected by DEG expression, immune cell infiltration, and mass CyTOF analyses. The results showed that CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and NK cells were abnormal in keloid tissue compared with normal skin tissue. These findings not only support the key roles of fibrosis-related pathways, immune cells and critical genes in the pathogenesis of keloids but also expand our understanding of targets that may be useful for the treatment of fibrotic diseases."

This is particularly important when we are dealing with complex pathogenesis without a direct causal agent, for example, syndromes with multiple organ involvements. Sjögren's syndrome is definitely such an entity. Also, there are a number of reasons for such studies such as disclosing the aetiology, to identify biomarkers for diagnosis and assessment of the disease process and monitor response to treatment, to determine targets for treatment, to define critical items in classification criteria, amongst others. Samples available for the study of disease mechanisms in Sjögren's syndrome have included serum (autoantibodies, cytokines), DNA (gene profiling, GWAS), cells (phenotypes/flow cytometry, proportion of cells/CyTOF), tissue (focal inflammation, germinal centres, mass cytometry), and saliva (proteomics, biochemistry, mucosal immunity). An original explanatory concept for the pathogenesis of Sjögren's syndrome proposed a specific and self-perpetuating immune-mediated loss of exocrine tissue as the principal cause of glandular hypofunction. This hypothesis however falls short of accommodating several Sjögren's syndrome-related phenomena and experimental findings. Today, the emergence of advanced bio-analytical platforms has further enabled the identification of central pathogenic processes and potential biomarkers. The purpose of this minor review is to highlight a selection of previous but also recent and novel aspects on the disease mechanisms in Sjögren's syndrome."

Various vaccine and administration factors influence the immune response to vaccination, including the route of vaccine delivery. We studied the dynamics of innate cell responses in blood using a preclinical model of non-human primates immunized with a live attenuated vaccinia virus, a recombinant Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) expressing a gag-pol-nef fusion of HIV-1, and mass cytometry. We previously showed that it induces a strong, early, and transient innate response, but also late phenotypic modifications of blood myeloid cells after two months when injected subcutaneously. Here, we show that the early innate effector cell responses and plasma inflammatory cytokine profiles differ between subcutaneous and intradermal vaccine injection. Additionally, we show that the intradermal administration fails to induce more highly activated/mature neutrophils long after immunization, in contrast to subcutaneous administration. Different batches of antibodies, staining protocols and generations of mass cytometers were used to generate the two datasets. Mass cytometry data were analyzed in parallel using the same analytical pipeline based on three successive clustering steps, including SPADE, and categorical heatmaps were compared using the Manhattan distance to measure the similarity between cell cluster phenotypes. Overall, we show that the vaccine per se is not sufficient for the late phenotypic modifications of innate myeloid cells, which are evocative of innate immune training. Its route of administration is also crucial, likely by influencing the early innate response, and systemic inflammation, and vaccine biodistribution."

Although the maternal mechanisms responsible have been well studied, those used by the fetal immune system remain poorly understood. Using suspension mass cytometry and various imaging modalities, we report a complex immune system within the mid-gestation (17-23 weeks) human placental villi (PV). Consistent with recent reports in other fetal organs, T cells with memory phenotypes, although rare in abundance, were detected within the PV tissue and vasculature. Moreover, we determined that T cells isolated from PV samples may be more proliferative after T cell receptor stimulation than adult T cells at baseline. Collectively, we identified multiple subtypes of fetal immune cells within the PV and specifically highlight the enhanced proliferative capacity of fetal PV T cells."

Inter- and intratumor heterogeneity in signaling within various tumor compartments and its impact on therapy are not well characterized due to the limited sensitivity of single-cell proteomic approaches. To overcome this barrier, we applied single-cell mass cytometry with a customized 26-antibody panel to PTEN-deleted orthotopic prostate cancer xenograft models to measure the evolution of kinase activities in different tumor compartments during metastasis or drug treatment. Compared with primary tumors and circulating tumor cells (CTC), bone metastases, but not lung and liver metastases, exhibited elevated PI3K/mTOR signaling and overexpressed receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) including c-MET protein. Suppression of c-MET impaired tumor growth in the bone. Intratumoral heterogeneity within tumor compartments also arose from highly proliferative EpCAM-high epithelial cells with increased PI3K and mTOR kinase activities coexisting with poorly proliferating EpCAM-low mesenchymal populations with reduced kinase activities; these findings were recapitulated in epithelial and mesenchymal CTC populations in patients with metastatic prostate and breast cancer. Increased kinase activity in EpCAM-high cells rendered them more sensitive to PI3K/mTOR inhibition, and drug-resistant EpCAM-low populations with reduced kinase activity emerged over time. Taken together, single-cell proteomics indicate that microenvironment- and cell state-dependent activation of kinase networks create heterogeneity and differential drug sensitivity among and within tumor populations across different sites, defining a new paradigm of drug responses to kinase inhibitors."

The most popular method for detecting proteins on single cells, flow cytometry, is limited by considerations of fluorescent spectral overlap. While mass cytometry (CyTOF) allows for the detection of upwards of 40 epitopes simultaneously, it requires local access to specialized instrumentation not commonly accessible to many laboratories. To overcome these limitations, we independently developed a method to quantify multiple protein targets on single cells without the need for specialty equipment other than access to widely available next generation sequencing (NGS) services. We demonstrate that this combinatorial indexing method compares favorably to traditional flow-cytometry, and allows over two dozen target proteins to be assayed at a time on single cells. To showcase the potential of the technique, we analyzed peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirates from human clinical samples, and identified pathogenic cellular subsets with high fidelity. The ease of use of this technique makes it a promising technology for high-throughput proteomics and for interrogating complex samples such as those from patients with leukemia."

We develop hDirect-MAP, an algorithm that maps T cells into a shared high-dimensional (HD) expression space of diverse T cell functional signatures in which cells group by the common T cell phenotypes rather than dimensional reduced features or a distorted view of these features. Using projection-free single-cell modeling, hDirect-MAP first removed a large group of cells that did not contribute to response and then clearly distinguished T cells into response-specific subpopulations that were defined by critical T cell functional markers of strong differential expression patterns. We found that these grouped cells cannot be distinguished by dimensional-reduction algorithms but are blended by diluted expression patterns. Moreover, these identified response-specific T cell subpopulations enabled a generalizable prediction by their HD metrics. Tested using five single-cell RNA-seq or mass cytometry datasets from basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma, hDirect-MAP demonstrated common response-specific T cell phenotypes that defined a generalizable and accurate predictive biomarker."

CD16 expression enabled immune-complex-mediated, T cell receptor-independent degranulation and cytotoxicity not found in other diseases. CD16+ T cells from COVID-19 patients promoted microvascular endothelial cell injury and release of neutrophil and monocyte chemoattractants. CD16+ T cell clones persisted beyond acute disease maintaining their cytotoxic phenotype. Increased generation of C3a in severe COVID-19 induced activated CD16+ cytotoxic T cells.

Although cell diversification fosters tumor evolution and therapy resistance, upstream mechanisms that regulate the stability and plasticity of the cancer epigenome remain elusive. Here we show that 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) not only suppresses DNA repair but also mediates the high-plasticity chromatin landscape. A combination of single-cell epigenomics and multi-omics approaches demonstrates that 2HG disarranges otherwise well-preserved stable nucleosome positioning and promotes cell-to-cell variability. 2HG induces loss of motif accessibility to the luminal-defining transcriptional factors FOXA1, FOXP1, and GATA3 and a shift from luminal to basal-like gene expression. Breast tumors with high 2HG exhibit enhanced heterogeneity with undifferentiated epigenomic signatures linked to adverse prognosis. Further, ascorbate-2-phosphate (A2P) eradicates heterogeneity and impairs growth of high 2HG-producing breast cancer cells. These findings suggest 2HG as a key determinant of cancer plasticity and provide a rational strategy to counteract tumor cell evolution."

CAN-2409 is a replication-deficient adenovirus that delivers herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase to cancer cells, resulting in local conversion of ganciclovir or valacyclovir into a toxic metabolite. This leads to highly immunogenic cell death, followed by a local immune response against a variety of cancer neoantigens and, next, a systemic immune response against the injected tumor and uninjected distant metastases. CAN-2409 treatment has shown promising results in clinical studies in glioblastoma (GBM). Patients with GBM are usually given the corticosteroid dexamethasone to manage edema. Previous work has suggested that concurrent dexamethasone therapy may have a negative effect in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with GBM.

The intra- and inter-cell-line single-cell heterogeneity is represented in the expression patterns of 13 markers-namely GLUT1, MCT4, CA9, TMEM45A, CD66, CD274 (PD-L1), CD24, CD326 (EpCAM), pan-keratin, TRA-1-60, galectin-3, galectin-1, and EGFR. The qRT-PCR and CyTOF analyses revealed that a hypoxic microenvironment and altered metabolism may influence cell-line heterogeneity. Additionally, human primary lung adenocarcinoma and non-involved healthy lung tissue biopsies were homogenized to prepare a single-cell suspension for CyTOF analysis. The CyTOF showed the ITH of human primary lung adenocarcinoma for 14 markers; particularly, the higher expressions of GLUT1, MCT4, CA9, TMEM45A, and CD66 were associated with the lung-tumor tissue.

A multimodal imaging approach was developed using spatially coregistered mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), imaging mass cytometry (IMC), multiplex immunofluorescence microscopy (mIF), and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining to assess the local distribution and metabolism of gemcitabine in tumors from a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer (KPC) allowing for comparisons between effects in the tumor tissue and its microenvironment. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) enabled the visualization of the distribution of gemcitabine (100 mg/kg), its phosphorylated metabolites dFdCMP, dFdCDP and dFdCTP, and the inactive metabolite dFdU. Distribution was compared to small-molecule ATR inhibitor AZD6738 (25 mg/kg), which was codosed. Gemcitabine metabolites showed heterogeneous distribution within the tumor, which was different from the parent compound. The highest abundance of dFdCMP, dFdCDP, and dFdCTP correlated with distribution of endogenous AMP, ADP, and ATP in viable tumor cell regions, showing that gemcitabine active metabolites are reaching the tumor cell compartment, while AZD6738 was located to nonviable tumor regions. The method revealed that the generation of active, phosphorylated dFdC metabolites as well as treatment-induced DNA damage primarily correlated with sites of high proliferation in KPC PDAC tumor tissue, rather than sites of high parent drug abundance."

Although AITD is more frequently diagnosed in adults, children are also affected but rarely studied. Here, we performed phenotypic and functional characterization of peripheral blood immune cells from pediatric and adult-onset AITD patients and age-matched controls using mass cytometry. Major findings indicate that unlike adult-onset AITD patients, pediatric AITD patients exhibit a decrease in anergic B cells (BND) and DN2 B cells and an increase in immature B cells compared to age-matched controls. These results indicate alterations in peripheral blood immune cells seen in pediatric-onset AITD could lead to rapid progression of disease. Hence, this study demonstrates diversity of AITD by showing differences in immune cell phenotypes and function based on age of onset, and may inform future therapies."

The pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) triggers activation of microglia. Microglia express many AD risk genes, suggesting that their response to AD pathology can affect disease progression. Microglia have long been considered a homogenous cell population. The diversity of microglia has gained great interest in recent years due to the emergence of novel single-cell technologies, such as single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing and single-cell mass cytometry by time-of-flight. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the diversity/heterogeneity of microglia and distinct microglia states in the brain of both AD mouse models and patients, as revealed by single-cell technologies. It also discusses the future developments for application of single-cell technologies and the integration of these technologies with functional studies to further dissect microglia biology in AD. Defining the functional correlates of distinct microglia states will shed new light on the pathological roles of microglia and might uncover new relevant therapeutic targets for AD."

Circulating platelets are heterogeneous in size, age, receptor expression, and reactivity. They inherit many features from megakaryocytes and are further modified on exposure to bioactive substances in the bloodstream. Among these substances, prothrombotic agonists, vasodilators, and bloodborne pathogens modulate platelet phenotypes via distinct signaling cascades. The ability of platelets to respond to (patho)physiologic signals is incompletely understood but likely depends on their repertoire of surface receptors, which may partition them into discrete subsets with specialized functions and divergent abilities. The single-cell resolution of flow and mass cytometry is ideal for immunophenotyping and allows the identification of platelet subsets in remarkable detail. In this report, we describe the surface markers and gating strategies needed for the comprehensive characterization of platelets."

To address this statistical challenge, we have developed a new approach, named Sensei, to determine the number of samples and the number of cells that are required to ascertain such changes between two groups of samples in single-cell studies. Sensei expands the t-test and models the cell abundances using a beta-binomial distribution.

Although the lipid-lowering and cardioprotective properties of bilirubin, as well as the negative relationship between bilirubin and atherosclerosis, were well documented, it is not yet clear whether bilirubin can attenuate atherosclerosis in vivo. In this study, we investigated the role of bilirubin in improving atherosclerosis. We found that mildly elevated bilirubin significantly reduced the risk factors of atherosclerosis, such as plasma glucose, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, liver total cholesterol, and cholesterol ester concentration in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice fed a western-type (high fat) diet. It was further found that bilirubin could promote the degradation of 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Reductase (HMGCR), a rate-limiting enzyme for endogenous cholesterol synthesis. Using mass cytometry-based high dimensional single cell analysis, we observed a decrease of natural killer cells and an increase of dendritic cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which all are closely associated with atherosclerosis risk factors and contribute to the improvement of atherosclerosis, in ApoE-/- mice treated with bilirubin. By in-depth analysis, modulation of multiple spleen or peripheral blood T cell clusters exhibiting either positive or negative correlations with total cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was detected after bilirubin treatment. In this study, we demonstrate that bilirubin serves as a negative regulator of atherosclerosis and reduces atherosclerosis by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis and modulating the immune system."

Quality control to prevent these types of errors is commonly embedded into the analysis of genomic datasets, but a similar identification strategy is not standard for cytometric data. Here, we present a method for detecting sample identification errors in cytometric data using expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles. We measured HLA-A*02 and HLA-B*07 expression in three longitudinal samples from 41 participants using a 33-marker CyTOF panel designed to identify major immune cell types. 3/123 samples (2.4%) showed HLA allele expression that did not match their longitudinal pairs. Furthermore, these same three samples' cytometric signature did not match qPCR HLA class I allele data, suggesting that they were accurately identified as mismatches. We conclude that this technique is useful for detecting sample-labeling errors in cytometric analyses of longitudinal data. This technique could also be used in conjunction with another method, like GWAS or PCR, to detect errors in cross-sectional data. We suggest widespread adoption of this or similar techniques will improve the quality of clinical studies that utilize cytometry."

Epub 2021 Dec 22.,Keywords: Administration schedule; Antitumor immunity; Immune checkpoint inhibitors; Immunochemotherapy; Mass cytometry.,"As a research hotspot, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is often combined with other therapeutics in order to exert better clinical efficacy. To date, extensive laboratory and clinical investigations into the combination of ICIs and chemotherapy have been carried out, demonstrating augmented effectiveness and broad application prospects in anti-tumor therapy. However, the administration of these two treatment modalities is usually randomized or fixed to a given chronological order. Nevertheless, the pharmacological effect of drug is closely related to its exposure behavior in vivo, which may consequently affect the synergistic outcomes of a combined therapy. In this study, we prepared a lipid nanoparticle encapsulating docetaxel (DTX-VNS), and associated it with the immune checkpoint inhibitor anti-PD-1 antibody (αPD-1) for the treatment of malignant tumors. To identify the optimum timing and sequencing for chemotherapy and immunotherapy, we designed three administration regimes, including the simultaneous delivery of DTX-VNS and αPD-1(DTX-VNS@αPD-1), DTX-VNS delivery before (DTX-VNS plus αPD-1) or post (αPD-1 plus DTX-VNS) PD-1 blockade with an interval of two days. Analysis from mass spectrometry, multi-factor detection and other techniques indicated that DTX-VNS plus αPD-1 initiated a powerful anti-tumor response in multiple tumor models, contributing to a remarkably reshaped tumor microenvironment landscape, which may attribute to the maximum therapeutic additive effects arise from a concomitant exposure of DTX-VNS and αPD-1 at the tumor site. By profiling the exposure kinetics of nanoparticles and αPD-1 in vivo, we defined the administration schedule with utmost therapeutic benefits, which may provide a valuable clinical reference for the rational administration of immunochemotherapy."

FAUST processes experimental data on a per-sample basis and returns biologically interpretable cell phenotypes, making it well suited for the analysis of complex datasets. We provide simulation studies that compare FAUST with existing methodology, exemplifying its strength. We apply FAUST to data from a Merkel cell carcinoma anti-PD-1 trial and discover pre-treatment effector memory T cell correlates of outcome co-expressing PD-1, HLA-DR, and CD28. Using FAUST, we then validate these correlates in cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from the same study, as well as an independent CyTOF dataset from a published metastatic melanoma trial. Finally, we show how FAUST's phenotypes can be used to perform cross-study data integration in the presence of diverse staining panels. Together, these results establish FAUST as a powerful new approach for unbiased discovery in single-cell cytometry."

Mass cytometry is an adaptation of flow cytometry in which antibodies are labeled with stable heavy metal isotopes and the readout is by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. With minimal spillover between channels, mass cytometry enables readouts of up to 60 parameters per single cell. Critically, mass cytometry can identify minority cell populations that are lost in bulk tissue analysis. Mass cytometry has been used to great effect for the study of immune cells. We have extended its use to examine single cells within disaggregated solid tissues, specifically freshly resected tubo-ovarian high-grade serous tumors.

We found that TREM2 deficiency impaired phagocytic clearance of pathological TDP-43 by microglia and enhanced neuronal damage and motor impairments. Mass cytometry analysis revealed that human TDP-43 (hTDP-43) induced a TREM2-dependent subpopulation of microglia with high CD11c expression and phagocytic ability. Using mass spectrometry (MS) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis, we further demonstrated an interaction between TDP-43 and TREM2 in vitro and in vivo as well as in human tissues from individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We computationally identified regions within hTDP-43 that interact with TREM2. Our data highlight that TDP-43 is a possible ligand for microglial TREM2 and that this interaction mediates neuroprotection of microglia in TDP-43-related neurodegeneration."

To shed some light on this, the cellular and molecular events following inhibition of PD-1 signaling was investigated in the MC-38 colon carcinoma model using constitutive (PD-1 KO) and conditional (PD1cKO) mice and in wild-type mice treated with PD-1 antibody. The impact on both tumor growth and the development of tumor immunity was assessed. In the PD-1cKO mice, a complete deletion of Pdcd1 in tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs) after tamoxifen treatment led to the inhibition of tumor growth of both small and large tumors. Extensive immune phenotypic analysis of the TILs by flow and mass cytometry identified 20-different T cell subsets of which specifically 5-CD8 positive ones expanded in all three models after PD-1 blockade. All five subsets expressed granzyme B and interferon gamma (IFNγ). Gene expression analysis of the tumor further supported the phenotypic analysis in both PD-1cKO- and PD-1 Ab-treated mice and showed an upregulation of pathways related to CD4 and CD8 T-cell activation, enhanced signaling through costimulatory molecules and IFNγ, and non-T-cell processes. Altogether, using PD-1cKO mice, we define the intrinsic nature of PD-1 suppression of CD8 T-cell responses in tumor immunity."

Here, we report a first-in-class phase 1/2 trial of L-NMMA combined with taxane for treating patients with chemorefractory, locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) or metastatic TNBC. We also examined immune cell correlates of chemotherapy response. 35 patients with metastatic TNBC were recruited: 15 in the phase 1 trial and 24 in the phase 2 trial (including 4 recommended phase 2 dose patients from the phase 1 trial). The overall response rate was 45.8% (11 of 24): 81.8% (9 of 11) for patients with LABC and 15.4% (2 of 13) for patients with metastatic TNBC. Among the patients with LABC, three patients had a pathological complete response at surgery (27.3%). Grade ≥3 toxicity was noted in 21% of patients; however, no adverse events were attributed to L-NMMA. Immune cells analyzed by CyTOF indicated that chemotherapy nonresponders showed greater expression of markers associated with M2 macrophage polarization and increased concentrations of circulating IL-6 and IL-10 cytokines. In contrast, chemotherapy responders showed an increase in CD15+ neutrophils in blood, as well as a decrease in arginase (a marker of protumor N2 neutrophils) in tumor biopsies obtained at the end of treatment. L-NMMA combined with taxane warrants further investigation in larger clinical studies of patients with breast cancer."

Here, the authors describe a mRNA virus-mimicking vaccine platform that is comprised of a phospholipid bilayer encapsulated with a protein-nucleotide core consisting of antigen-encoding mRNA molecules, unmethylated CpG oligonucleotides and positively charged proteins. In cell culture, VLVP potently stimulated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) to express inflammatory cytokines that facilitated dendritic cell (DC) maturation and promoted antigen processing and presentation. In tumor-bearing mice, VLVP treatment stimulated proliferation of antigen-specific CD8+T cells in the lymphatic organs and T cell infiltration into the tumor bed, resulting in potent anti-tumor immunity. Cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) analysis revealed that VLVP treatment stimulated a 5-fold increase in tumor-associated CD8+DCs and a 4-fold increase in tumorinfiltrated CD8+T cells, with concurrent decreases in tumor-associated bone marrow-derived suppressor cells and arginase 1- expressing suppressive DCs. Finally, CpG oligonucleotide is an essential adjuvant for vaccine activity. Inclusion of CpG not only maximized vaccine activity but also prevented PD-1 expression in T cells, serving the dual roles as a potent adjuvant and a checkpoint blockade agent."

There is however no clear understanding of the features underlying a more or less effective response. Mtb glycolipids are abundant in the bacterial cell envelope and modulate the immune response to Mtb, but the patterns of response to glycolipids are still underexplored. To identify the CD45+ leukocyte activation landscape induced by Mtb glycolipids in peripheral blood of ATB and LTB, we performed a detailed assessment of the immune response of PBMCs to the Mtb glycolipids lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and its biosynthetic precursor phosphatidyl-inositol mannoside (PIM), and purified-protein derivate (PPD). At 24 h of stimulation, cell profiling and secretome analysis was done using mass cytometry and high-multiplex immunoassay. PIM induced a diverse cytokine response, mainly affecting antigen-presenting cells to produce both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, but not IFN-γ, contrasting with PPD that was a strong inducer of IFN-γ. The effect of PIM on the antigen-presenting cells was partly TLR2-dependent. Expansion of monocyte subsets in response to PIM or LAM was reduced primarily in LTB as compared to healthy controls, suggesting a hyporesponsive/tolerance pattern derived from Mtb infection."

These gut-evolved strains protect the host from infection by a wide range of pathogens via trained immunity. Here, we further investigated the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this innate immune memory. Both Dectin-1 (the main receptor for β-glucan; a well-described immune training molecule in the fungal cell wall) and Nod2 (a receptor described to mediate BCG-induced trained immunity), were redundant for the protection induced by gut-evolved C. albicans against a virulent C. albicans strain, suggesting that gut-evolved C. albicans strains induce trained immunity via other pathways. Cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) analysis of mouse splenocytes revealed that immunization with gut-evolved C. albicans resulted in an expansion of neutrophils and a reduction in natural killer (NK) cells, but no significant numeric changes in monocytes, macrophages or dendritic cell populations. Systemic depletion of phagocytes or neutrophils, but not of macrophages or NK cells, reduced protection mediated by gut-evolved C. albicans. Splenocytes and bone marrow cells of mice immunized with gut-evolved C. albicans demonstrated metabolic changes. In particular, splenic neutrophils displayed significantly elevated glycolytic and respiratory activity in comparison to those from mock-immunized mice. Although further investigation is required for fully deciphering the trained immunity mechanism induced by gut-evolved C. albicans strains, this data is consistent with the existence of several mechanisms of trained immunity, triggered by different training stimuli and involving different immune molecules and cell types."

These LnNPs must be coated to provide colloidal stability in aqueous buffer and functionality for detecting cellular biomarkers. Lipid bilayer coatings are a promising approach, but one requires an analytical technique to enable characterization of the NP coating composition as opposed to the composition of the lipid formulation used in the coating process. However, quantification of the lipid composition of lipid coatings on polymer and inorganic NPs is not common practice in the field. Here we describe a method based on high-performance liquid chromatography (LC) for separations and triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) instrumentation for detection and show that it can quantify complex lipid mixtures using small (<1 μg) amounts of sample. Our lipid formulation consisted of a mixture of egg sphingomyelin, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane, cholesterol-PEG600, and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[biotinyl(polyethylene glycol)-2000]. We were able to extract the coating from lipid-coated 35 nm diameter LnNPs, quantify the lipid/NP ratio, and show that the coating composition differed from the composition of the lipid formulation for several of the species. Knowledge of the actual composition of the lipid coating for lipid-coated NPs is critical for designing and optimizing application of these materials. Our results establish the value of LC-MS/MS characterization of lipid-coated NPs, thus providing an important new addition to the toolbox available for characterizing these types of nanomaterials."

Epub 2021 Dec 4.,Keywords: Cancer; CyTOF; Heterogeneity; Neutrophils; scRNA-seq.,"Neutrophils have historically been considered a singular, terminally-differentiated cell population, replete with pre-formed granules, poised to react quickly, aggressively, and somewhat non-specifically in the face of a microbial challenge or tissue injury. However, in recent years, neutrophil biologists have started revisiting this simplistic conception. Many studies have identified complexities in neutrophil biology, and these findings have led the field to redefine neutrophil heterogeneity from multiple angles including their development and maturation, their tissue location, and their ability to respond to various (pathological) stimuli. In this review, we discuss the importance of this reassessment within the context of cancer. Experimental evidence supports that neutrophil behavior is diverse, context-dependent, and manipulable; cutting-edge technologies have enabled the identification of neutrophil heterogeneity with high resolution and in an unbiased manner, revealing what may be critical underpinnings of these diverse behaviors, and enabling sophisticated computational assessments of specific programs and interactions. We are coming ever closer to delineating a holistic picture of neutrophil heterogeneity and how it may interplay with cancer stage, tumor microenvironment, and therapy. All of this together paints a promising picture when considering how clinical practice may harness the heterogeneity of these cells, for biomarkers or therapeutic approaches, leveraging what we are learning about these powerful and plentiful immune effectors."

Previous studies showed that natural killer (NK) cells can be stimulated ex vivo with interleukin-12 (IL-12), -15, and -18 to generate memory-like (ML) NK cells with enhanced antileukemia responses. We treated 9 pediatric/YA patients with post-HCT relapsed AML with donor ML NK cells in a phase 1 trial. Patients received fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim followed 2 weeks later by infusion of donor lymphocytes and ML NK cells from the original HCT donor. ML NK cells were successfully generated from haploidentical and matched-related and -unrelated donors. After infusion, donor-derived ML NK cells expanded and maintained an ML multidimensional mass cytometry phenotype for >3 months. Furthermore, ML NK cells exhibited persistent functional responses as evidenced by leukemia-triggered interferon-γ production. After DLI and ML NK cell adoptive transfer, 4 of 8 evaluable patients achieved complete remission at day 28. Two patients maintained a durable remission for >3 months, with 1 patient in remission for >2 years. No significant toxicity was experienced. This study demonstrates that, in a compatible post-HCT immune environment, donor ML NK cells robustly expand and persist with potent antileukemic activity in the absence of exogenous cytokines. ML NK cells in combination with DLI present a novel immunotherapy platform for AML that has relapsed after allogeneic HCT. This trial was registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03068819."

The clinical and immunological consequences of deficiencies in some of its components such as CARD9, CARD11, and MALT1 have been elucidated in detail. However, the scarcity of BCL10 deficient patients has prevented gaining detailed knowledge about this genetic disease. Only two patients with BCL10 deficiency have been reported to date. Here we provide an in-depth description of an additional patient with autosomal recessive complete BCL10 deficiency caused by a nonsense mutation that leads to a loss of expression (K63X). Using mass cytometry coupled with unsupervised clustering and machine learning computational methods, we obtained a thorough characterization of the consequences of BCL10 deficiency in different populations of leukocytes. We showed that in addition to the near absence of memory B and T cells previously reported, this patient displays a reduction in NK, γδT, Tregs, and TFH cells. The patient had recurrent respiratory infections since early childhood, and showed a family history of lethal severe infectious diseases. Fortunately, hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) cured her. Overall, this report highlights the importance of early genetic diagnosis for the management of BCL10 deficient patients and HSCT as the recommended treatment to cure this disease."

The immune response requires tight regulation and can be influenced by additional risk factors such as obesity, which is considered a state of chronic inflammation. Utilizing high-dimensional mass and regular flow cytometry, we define key signatures of obesity-related alterations of the immune system during the response to the trauma. In this context, we report a modification in important components of the splenic response to the inflammatory reflex in obese mice. Furthermore, during the response to trauma, obese mice exhibit a prolonged increase of neutrophils and an early accumulation of inflammation associated CCR2+CD62L+Ly6Chi monocytes in the blood, contributing to a persistent inflammatory phase. Moreover, these mice exhibit differences in migration patterns of monocytes to the traumatized lung, resulting in decreased numbers of regenerative macrophages and an impaired M1/M2 switch in traumatized lungs. The findings presented in this study reveal an attenuation of the inflammatory reflex in obese mice, as well as a disturbance of the monocytic compartment contributing to a prolonged inflammation phase resulting in fewer phenotypically regenerative macrophages in the lung of obese mice."

Epub 2021 Dec 1.,Keywords: Joint pain; Reprogramming; Synovial macrophages.,"Osteoarthritis is the most common form of joint disease and is one of the leading causes of chronic pain. Given the multi-factorial nature, numerous efforts have been made to clarify the multiple factors impacting the pain symptoms and joint pathology, including synovial macrophages in particular. Accumulating evidence from studies involving human participants and experimental animal models suggests that accumulating macrophages in synovial tissue are implicated in peripherally mediated pain sensitization of affected joints in osteoarthritis. Crosstalk between synovial macrophages and the innervating primary nociceptive neurons is thought to contribute to this facilitated pain processing by the peripheral nervous system. Due to high plasticity and complexity of synovial macrophages in the joint, safe therapies targeting single cells or molecules are currently lacking. Using advanced technologies (such as single-cell RNA sequencing and mass cytometry), studies have shown that diverse subpopulations of synovial macrophages exist in the distinct synovial microenvironments of specific osteoarthritis subtypes. Considerable progress has been made in delineating the molecular mechanisms of various subsets of synovial macrophages in the development of osteoarthritis. To develop a novel intra-articular treatment paradigm targeting synovial macrophages, we have summarized in this review the recent advances in identifying the functional consequences of synovial macrophage sub-populations and understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving macrophage-mediated remodeling."

This approach allowed rapid and standardized manufacturing of billions of hiPSCs that can be produced in parallel from up to 90 different patient- and disease-specific cell lines. Moreover, we established automated multi-lineage differentiation and generated functional neurons, cardiomyocytes, and hepatocytes. To validate our approach, we compared robotic and manual cell culture operations and performed comprehensive molecular and cellular characterizations (e.g., single-cell transcriptomics, mass cytometry, metabolism, electrophysiology) to benchmark industrial-scale cell culture operations toward building an integrated platform for efficient cell manufacturing for disease modeling, drug screening, and cell therapy."

Further, bulk RNA sequencing confirmed increases in cytokine-related signaling pathways and NF-κB target genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing of unstimulated and stimulated cells confirmed altered IL-1β transcriptional responses in the IDH2 mutant cells. Targeted inhibition of the IKK complex reduced IL-1β responses and induced cell death in primary IDH-mutated leukemia samples. Together, these results confirm altered IL-1β signaling in IDH2 mutant cells and identify this pathway as a potential therapeutic target."

Many data analysis methods for cytometry data focus solely on identifying subpopulations via clustering and testing for differential cell abundance. For differential expression analysis of markers between conditions, only few tools exist. These tools either reduce the data distribution to medians, discarding valuable information, or have underlying assumptions that may not hold for all expression patterns. Here, we systematically evaluated existing and novel approaches for differential expression analysis on real and simulated CyTOF data. We found that methods using median marker expressions compute fast and reliable results when the data are not strongly zero-inflated. Methods using all data detect changes in strongly zero-inflated markers, but partially suffer from overprediction or cannot handle big datasets. We present a new method, CyEMD, based on calculating the earth mover's distance between expression distributions that can handle strong zero-inflation without being too sensitive.

However, the impact of accumulative drug administration on the recipients' immune systems remains unclear. We investigated the impact of 3-year FK506 or RAPA treatment after renal transplantation on the human immune systems. A discovery cohort of 30 patients was first recruited, and we discovered two distinctive T lineage suppressive regulatory patterns induced by chronic treatment of FK506 and RAPA. The increased percentage of senescent CD8+ CD57+ T lineages and less responsive T cell receptor (TCR) pathway in the FK506 group indicate better graft acceptance. Meanwhile, percentages of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and expression of CTLA-4 were both up to two-fold higher in the RAPA group, suggesting the inconsistent reactivation potential of the FK506 and RAPA groups when an anti-tumour or anti-infection immune response is concerned. Additionally, up-regulation of phosphorylated signaling proteins in T lineages after in vitro CD3/CD28 stimulation suggested more sensitive TCR-signaling pathways reserved in the RAPA group. An independent validation cohort of 100 renal transplantation patients was further investigated for the hypothesis that long-term RAPA administration mitigates the development of tumours and infections during long-term intake of immunosuppressants. Our results indicate that RAPA administration indeed results in less clinical oncogenesis and infection. The deep phenotyping of T-cell lineages, as educated by the long-term treatment of different immunosuppressants, provides new evidence for personalized precision medicine after renal transplantations."

In this study, we employed patient-derived samples from SLE-associated PAH (SLE-PAH) and established comparable mouse models to clarify the role of BMP signaling in the pathobiology of SLE-PAH. Firstly, serum levels of LPS and autoantibodies (auto-Abs) directed at BMP receptors were significantly increased in patients with SLE-PAH compared with control subjects, measured by ELISA. Mass cytometry was applied to compare peripheral blood leukocyte phenotype in patients prior to and after treatment with steroids, which demonstrated inflammatory cells alteration in SLE-PAH. Furthermore, BMPR2 signaling and pyroptotic factors were examined in human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAECs) in response to LPS stimulation. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and E-selectin (SELE) expressions were up-regulated in autologous BMPR2+/R899X endothelial cells and siBMPR2-interfered PAECs. A SLE-PH model was established in mice induced with pristane and hypoxia. Moreover, the combination of endothelial specific BMPR2 knockout in SLE mice exacerbated pulmonary hypertension. Pyroptotic factors including gasdermin D (GSDMD) were elevated in the lungs of SLE-PH mice, and the pyroptotic effects of serum samples isolated from SLE-PAH patients on PAECs were analyzed.

Methods and Results: Sult2b1-/- and wild-type mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Our data showed that Sult2b1-/- mice had larger infarction and worse neurological scores. To determine whether immune cells were involved in the worsening stroke outcome in Sult2b1-/- mice, bone marrow transplantation, immune cell depletion, and adoptive monocyte transfer were performed. Combined with CyTOF and immunofluorescence techniques, we demonstrated that after stroke, the peripheral monocyte-derived macrophages were the dominant cell type promoting the pro-inflammatory status in Sult2b1-/-mice. Using primary bone marrow-derived macrophages, we showed that cholesterol sulfate could attenuate the pro-inflammatory polarization of macrophages under both normal and oxygen-glucose deprivation conditions by regulating the levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and activating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) - cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB) signaling pathway. Conclusions:Sult2b1-/- promoted the polarization of macrophages into pro-inflammatory status. This trend could be attenuated by adding cholesterol sulfate, which promotes the polarization of macrophages into anti-inflammatory status by metabolic regulation. In this study, we established an inflammation-metabolism axis during the macrophage polarization after ischemic stroke."

Here, we disclosed the effects of GO and amino-functionalized GO (GONH2) interacting with human B cells in vitro and ex vivo at the protein and gene expression levels. Moreover, our study considered three different subpopulations of B cells and their functionality in terms of: (i) cytokine production, (ii) activation markers, (iii) killing activity towards cancer cells. Single-cell mass cytometry screening revealed the higher impact of GO on cell viability towards naïve, memory, and plasma B cell subsets. Different cytokines such as granzyme B (GrB) and activation markers, like CD69, CD80, CD138, and CD38, were differently regulated by GONH2 compared to GO, supporting possible diverse B cell activation paths. Moreover, co-culture experiments also suggest the functional ability of both GOs to activate B cells and therefore enhance the toxicity towards HeLa cancer cell line. Complete transcriptomic analysis on a B cell line highlighted the distinctive GO and GONH2 elicited responses, inducing pathways such as B cell receptor and CD40 signaling pathways, key players for GrB secretion. B cells were regularly left behind the scenes in graphene biological studies; our results may open new horizons in the development of GO-based immune-modulatory strategies having B cell as main actors."

Herein, we develop a mass cytometry-based strategy for unbiased mining of cell subsets that potentially contribute to cancer recurrence through panoramic examination of the immunophenotypic features and multidrug resistance characteristics. The incorporation of metal tags enables multiplexed information of single cells to be interrogated based on metal fingerprint. Using acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) as a showcase, we show overexpressed multidrug resistance biomarkers, i. e., BCRP, Bcl-2, MRP1, and P-gp in B-ALL cells compared with healthy control, and a positive correlation among different multidrug resistance biomarkers. Different cell subsets with multidrug resistance are well-defined, featured with CD34+ CD38+ CD10- and CD34+ CD38+/int CD10+ . Importantly, we uncovered that CD34 expression level is positively correlated to multidrug resistance, indicative of a higher potential of immature cells to induce B-ALL relapse. In addition, the cell subsets positively expressing CD73 and CD304 (CD34+ CD10+ CD304+ ; CD34+ CD38+/int CD10+ CD73+ ) also overexpress multidrug resistance biomarkers, suggesting that they may serve as additional new biomarkers for B-ALL stratification and prognosis. Our data provide the first evidence that highly expressed multidrug resistance biomarkers in certain cell subpopulations with specific immunophenotypes may potentially induce B-ALL recurrence. The incorporation of multidrug resistance features with cell phenotypes using mass cytometry proposed in this study provides a general strategy for risk assessment and the prediction of recurrence of different types of cancers."

Such combinations significantly improve efficacy, but treatment-related adverse events have also become more complex and severe. Here, we report an acute toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)-like reaction in a patient with gallbladder cancer who received camrelizumab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) in combination with apatinib. Interestingly, distinct clinical and pathological characteristics were observed that differed from those of the reported cases of severe cutaneous reactions induced by anti-PD-1 antibodies alone; thus, we speculate that it was induced by the combination of camrelizumab and apatinib. It is worth noting that the TEN-like reaction showed resistance to methylprednisolone initially, which was gradually resolved after the addition of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the skin lesion was infiltrated by moderate numbers of CD4+ T cells and large numbers of CD8+ T cells during the progression of the TEN-like reaction, and mass cytometry by time-of-flight showed a significant reduction in the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proportions in the peripheral blood after the rash improved. All these findings highlight the essential role of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in the TEN-like reaction induced by camrelizumab plus apatinib treatment, and we speculate that T cells, especially CD8+ T cells, attack keratinocytes. In conclusion, the TEN-like reaction induced by camrelizumab and apatinib deserves clinical attention, and further work is needed to elucidate the exact pathophysiologic mechanism as well as the optimal management strategy."

Several subsets of differentiated CD8+ T cells have been identified, however, a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanism that underlies T-cell differentiation is lacking. Conventional approaches to the study of immune responses are typically limited to the analysis of bulk groups of cells that mask the cells' heterogeneity (RNA-seq, microarray) and to the assessment of a relatively limited number of biomarkers that can be evaluated simultaneously at the population level (flow and mass cytometry). Single-cell analysis, on the other hand, represents a possible alternative that enables a deeper characterization of the underlying cellular heterogeneity. In this study, a murine model was used to characterize immunodominant hemagglutinin (HA533-541)-specific CD8+ T-cell responses to nucleic- and protein-based influenza vaccine candidates, using single-cell sorting followed by transcriptomic analysis. Investigation of single-cell gene expression profiles enabled the discovery of unique subsets of CD8+ T cells that co-expressed cytotoxic genes after vaccination. Moreover, this method enabled the characterization of antigen specific CD8+ T cells that were previously undetected. Single-cell transcriptome profiling has the potential to allow for qualitative discrimination of cells, which could lead to novel insights on biological pathways involved in cellular responses. This approach could be further validated and allow for more informed decision making in preclinical and clinical settings."

Disruption of the regulatory mechanisms governing the cell cycle is a feature of a number of diseases, including cancer. Study of the cell cycle necessitates the ability to define the number of cells in each portion of cell cycle progression as well as to clearly delineate between each cell cycle phase. The advent of mass cytometry (MCM) provides tremendous potential for high throughput single cell analysis through direct measurements of elemental isotopes, and the development of a method to measure the cell cycle state by MCM further extends the utility of MCM. Here we describe a method that directly measures 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (IdU), similar to 5-bromo-2´-deoxyuridine (BrdU), in an MCM system. Use of this IdU-based MCM provides several advantages. First, IdU is rapidly incorporated into DNA during its synthesis, allowing reliable measurement of cells in the S-phase with incubations as short as 10-15 minutes. Second, IdU is measured without the need for secondary antibodies or the need for DNA degradation. Third, IdU staining can be easily combined with measurement of cyclin B1, phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRb), and phosphorylated histone H3 (pHH3), which collectively provides clear delineation of the five cell cycle phases. Combination of these cell cycle markers with the high number of parameters possible with MCM allow combination with numerous other metrics."

At present, sepsis diagnosis relies on nonspecific clinical features. It could transform clinical care to have immune-cell biomarkers that could predict sepsis diagnosis and guide treatment. For decades, neutrophil phenotypes have been studied in sepsis, but a diagnostic cell subset has yet to be identified. Objectives: To identify an early, specific immune signature of sepsis severity that does not overlap with other inflammatory biomarkers and that distinguishes patients with sepsis from those with noninfectious inflammatory syndrome. Methods: Mass cytometry combined with computational high-dimensional data analysis was used to measure 42 markers on whole-blood immune cells from patients with sepsis and control subjects and to automatically and comprehensively characterize circulating immune cells, which enables identification of novel, disease-specific cellular signatures. Measurements and Main Results: Unsupervised analysis of high-dimensional mass cytometry data characterized previously unappreciated heterogeneity within the CD64+ immature neutrophils and revealed two new subsets distinguished by CD123 and PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1) expression. These immature neutrophils exhibited diminished activation and phagocytosis functions. The proportion of CD123-expressing neutrophils correlated with clinical severity. Conclusions: This study showed that these two new neutrophil subsets were specific to sepsis and detectable through routine flow cytometry by using seven markers. The demonstration here that a simple blood test distinguishes sepsis from other inflammatory conditions represents a key biological milestone that can be immediately translated into improvements in patient care."

We focused on receptors involved in interactions between immune cells and virus-infected cells. We found that the diversity of receptor repertoires on natural killer (NK) cells was negatively correlated with the viral clearance rate. In addition, NK subsets expressing the receptor DNAM1 were increased in patients who more rapidly recovered from infection. Ex vivo functional studies revealed that NK subpopulations with high DNAM1 expression had cytolytic activities in response to target cell stimulation. We also found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced the expression of CD155 and nectin-4, ligands of DNAM1 and its paired coinhibitory receptor TIGIT, which counterbalanced the cytolytic activities of NK cells. Collectively, our results link the cytolytic immune responses of NK cells to the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and show that the DNAM1 pathway modulates host-pathogen interactions during SARS-CoV-2 infection."

However, its limited resolution and ultralow acquisition speed remain major issues for general clinical application. Meanwhile, conventional immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM) allows sub-micrometer resolution and rapid identification of the region of interest (ROI), but only operates with low multiplicity. Herein, a series of lanthanide-doped blue-, green-, and red-fluorescent carbon nanodots (namely, B-Cdots(Ln1 ), G-Cdots(Ln2 ), and R-Cdots(Ln3 )) as fluorescence and mass dual-modal tags are developed. Coupled with aptamers, B-Cdots(159 Tb)-A10-3.2, G-Cdots(165 Ho)-AS1411, and R-Cdots(169 Tm)-SYL3C dual-functional aptamer probes, which are then multiplexed with commercially available Maxpar metal-tagged antibodies for analyzing clinical formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) prostatic adenocarcinoma (PaC) tissue, are further synthesized. The rapid identification of ROI with IFM using fluorescence signals and subsequent multiplexed detection of in situ ROI with IMC using the same tissue section is demonstrated. Dual-modal probes save up to 90% IMC blind scanning time for a standard 3.5 mm × 3.5 mm overall image. Meanwhile, the IFM provides refined details and topological spatial distributions for the functional proteins at optical resolution, which compensates for the low resolution of the IMC imaging."

Here, we analyzed the tumor immune environment in pediatric B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia by analyzing serial bone marrow samples from nine patients with primary and recurrent disease by mass cytometry using 39 immunophenotype markers, and transcriptome analysis. High-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry analysis elucidated a dynamic shift of T cells from naïve to effector subsets, and clarified that, during relapse, the tumor immune environment comprised a T helper 1-polarized immune profile, together with an increased number of effector regulatory T cells. These results were confirmed in a validation cohort using conventional flow cytometry. Furthermore, RNA transcriptome analysis identified the upregulation of immune-related pathways in B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells during relapse, suggesting interaction with the surrounding environment. In conclusion, a tumor immune environment characterized by a T helper 1-polarized immune profile, with an increased number of effector regulatory T cells, could contribute to the pathophysiology of recurrent B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This information could contribute to the development of effective immunotherapeutic approaches against B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse."

SARS-CoV-2 infection is known to alter immune system homeostasis. Whether cancer patients developing COVID-19 present alterations of immune functions which might contribute to worse outcomes have so far been poorly investigated. We conducted a multi-omic analysis of immunological parameters in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of COVID-19 patients with and without cancer. Healthy donors and SARS-CoV-2-negative cancer patients were also included as controls. At the infection peak, cytokine multiplex analysis of blood samples, cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) cell population analyses, and Nanostring gene expression using Pancancer array on PBMCs were performed. We found that eight pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-8, IL-13, IL-1ra, MIP-1a, IP-10) out of 27 analyzed serum cytokines were modulated in COVID-19 patients irrespective of cancer status. Diverse subpopulations of T lymphocytes such as CD8+T, CD4+T central memory, Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT), natural killer (NK), and γδ T cells were reduced, while B plasmablasts were expanded in COVID-19 cancer patients. Our findings illustrate a repertoire of aberrant alterations of gene expression in circulating immune cells of COVID-19 cancer patients. A 19-gene expression signature of PBMCs is able to discriminate COVID-19 patients with and without solid cancers. Gene set enrichment analysis highlights an increased gene expression linked to Interferon α, γ, α/β response and signaling which paired with aberrant cell cycle regulation in cancer patients. Ten out of the 19 genes, validated in a real-world consecutive cohort, were specific of COVID-19 cancer patients independently from different cancer types and stages of the diseases, and useful to stratify patients in a COVID-19 disease severity-manner.

Here, we report the cases of two ATL patients who did not develop acute GVHD despite receiving Mog before allo-HCT. Case 1: a 63-year-old female who underwent allo-HCT from an HLA-matched donor 2 months after the last dose of Mog. Case 2: a 47-year-old male with ATL that relapsed 3 months after first allo-HCT. He received eight doses of Mog and underwent a second allo-HCT from a haploidentical donor 4 months after the last dose of Mog. Mog blood levels were measured and lymphocytes analyzed by mass cytometry. Mog blood levels measured before starting the conditioning regimens were low. A small proportion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) was detected before and shortly after allo-HCT. When using Mog before allo-HCT, it is important to consider the number of Mog doses and the interval from the last dose of Mog to allo-HCT. Analyzing Mog blood levels and Treg counts before and after allo-HCT should also be useful."

Whether this effect is direct or a consequence of global immune changes with effects on NK-cell homeostasis remains unknown. In this study, we used high-resolution flow and mass cytometry to examine NK-cell repertoires in 64 patients with neutropenia and 27 healthy age- and sex-matched donors. A subgroup of patients with chronic neutropenia showed severely disrupted NK-cell homeostasis manifesting as increased frequencies of CD56bright NK cells and a lack of mature CD56dim NK cells. These immature NK-cell repertoires were characterized by expression of the proliferation/exhaustion markers Ki-67, Tim-3, and TIGIT and displayed blunted tumor target cell responses. Systems-level immune mapping revealed that the changes in immunophenotypes were confined to NK cells, leaving T-cell differentiation intact. RNA sequencing of NK cells from these patients showed upregulation of a network of genes, including TNFSF9, CENPF, MKI67, and TOP2A, associated with apoptosis and the cell cycle, but different from the conventional CD56bright signatures. Profiling of 249 plasma proteins showed a coordinated enrichment of pathways related to apoptosis and cell turnover, which correlated with immature NK-cell repertoires. Notably, most of these patients exhibited severe-grade neutropenia, suggesting that the profoundly altered NK-cell homeostasis was connected to the severity of their underlying etiology. Hence, although our data suggest that neutrophils are dispensable for NK-cell development and differentiation, some patients displayed a specific gap in the NK repertoire, associated with poor cytotoxic function and more severe disease manifestations."

The molecular mechanisms by which MEx afford beneficial effects remain incompletely understood. Objectives: To investigate the therapeutic mechanism of action through assessment of MEx biodistribution and impact on immune cell phenotypic heterogeneity. Methods: MEx were isolated from the conditioned medium of human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs. Newborn mice were exposed to hyperoxia (HYRX, 75% O2) from birth and returned to room air at Postnatal Day 14 (PN14). Mice received either a bolus intravenous MEx dose at PN4 or bone marrow-derived myeloid cells (BMDMy) pretreated with MEx. Animals were killed at PN4, PN7, PN14, or PN28 to characterize MEx biodistribution or for assessment of pulmonary parameters. The therapeutic role of MEx-educated BMDMy was determined in vitro and in vivo. Measurements and Main Results: MEx therapy ameliorated core histological features of HYRX-induced neonatal lung injury. Biodistribution and mass cytometry studies demonstrated that MEx localize in the lung and interact with myeloid cells. MEx restored the apportion of alveolar macrophages in the HYRX-injured lung and concomitantly suppressed inflammatory cytokine production. In vitro and ex vivo studies revealed that MEx promoted an immunosuppressive BMDMy phenotype. Functional assays demonstrated that the immunosuppressive actions of BMDMy are driven by phenotypically and epigenetically reprogrammed monocytes. Adoptive transfer of MEx-educated BMDMy, but not naive BMDMy, restored alveolar architecture, blunted fibrosis and pulmonary vascular remodeling, and improved exercise capacity. Conclusions: MEx ameliorate hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury though epigenetic and phenotypic reprogramming of myeloid cells."

However, it remains uncertain whether SCFAs affect the formation of CaOx stones through immunomodulation. We first performed mass cytometry (CyTOF) and RNA sequencing on kidney immune cells with glyoxylate-induced CaOx crystals (to elucidate the landscape of the associated immune cell population) and explored the role of SCFAs in renal CaOx stone formation through immunomodulation. We identified 29 distinct immune cell subtypes in kidneys with CaOx crystals, where CX3CR1+CD24- macrophages significantly decreased and GR1+ neutrophils significantly increased. In accordance with the CyTOF data, RNA sequencing showed that most genes involved were related to monocytes and neutrophils. SCFAs reduced kidney CaOx crystals by increasing the frequency of CX3CR1+CD24- macrophages and decreasing GR1+ neutrophil infiltration in kidneys with CaOx crystals, which was dependent on the gut microbiota. GPR43 knockdown by transduction with adeno-associated virus inhibited the alleviation of crystal formation and immunomodulatory effects in the kidney, due to SCFAs. Moreover, CX3CR1+CD24- macrophages regulated GR1+ neutrophils via GPR43. Our results demonstrated a unique trilateral relationship among SCFAs, immune cells, and the kidneys during CaOx formation. These findings suggest that future immunotherapies may be used to prevent kidney stones using SCFAs."

Towards this end, we combine DNA nanotechnology with single-molecule force spectroscopy to create a mechanically reconfigurable DNA nanoswitch caliper capable of measuring multiple coordinates on single biomolecules with atomic resolution. Using optical tweezers, we demonstrate absolute distance measurements with ångström-level precision for both DNA and peptides, and using multiplexed magnetic tweezers, we demonstrate quantification of relative abundance in mixed samples. Measuring distances between DNA-labelled residues, we perform single-molecule fingerprinting of synthetic and natural peptides, and show discrimination, within a heterogeneous population, between different posttranslational modifications. DNA nanoswitch calipers are a powerful and accessible tool for characterizing distances within nanoscale complexes that will enable new applications in fields such as single-molecule proteomics."

Targeted therapy of resistant and high-risk pediatric T-ALL is therefore urgently needed, together with precision medicine tools allowing the testing of efficacy in patient samples. Furthermore, leukemic cell heterogeneity requires drug response assessment at the single-cell level. Here we used single-cell mass cytometry to study signal transduction pathways such as JAK-STAT, PI3K-AKT-mTOR and MEK-ERK in 16 diagnostic and five relapsed T-ALL primary samples, and investigated the in vitro response of cells to Interleukin-7 (IL-7) and the inhibitor BEZ-235. T-ALL cells showed upregulated activity of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR and MEK-ERK pathways and increased expression of proliferation and translation markers. We found that perturbation induced by the ex vivo administration of either IL-7 or BEZ-235 reveals a high degree of exclusivity with respect to the phospho-protein responsiveness to these agents. Notably, these response signatures were maintained from diagnosis to relapse in individual patients. In conclusion, we demonstrated the power of mass cytometry single-cell profiling of signal transduction pathways in T-ALL. Taking advantage of this advanced approach, we were able to identify distinct clusters with different responsiveness to IL-7 and BEZ-235 that can persist at relapse. Collectively our observations can contribute to a better understanding of the complex signaling network governing T-ALL behavior and its correlation with influence on the response to therapy."

Epub 2021 Oct 18.,Keywords: galvanotaxis; glycan; infection; macrophages; salmonella.,"Salmonella invades and disrupts gut epithelium integrity, creating an infection-generated electric field that can drive directional migration of macrophages, a process called galvanotaxis. Phagocytosis of bacteria reverses the direction of macrophage galvanotaxis, implicating a bioelectrical mechanism to initiate life-threatening disseminations. The force that drives direction reversal of macrophage galvanotaxis is not understood. One hypothesis is that Salmonella can alter the electrical properties of the macrophages by modifying host cell surface glycan composition, which is supported by the fact that cleavage of surface-exposed sialic acids with a bacterial neuraminidase severely impairs macrophage galvanotaxis, as well as phagocytosis. Here, we utilize N-glycan profiling by nanoLC-chip QTOF mass cytometry to characterize the bacterial neuraminidase-associated compositional shift of the macrophage glycocalyx, which revealed a decrease in sialylated and an increase in fucosylated and high mannose structures. The Salmonella nanH gene, encoding a putative neuraminidase, is required for invasion and internalization in a human colonic epithelial cell infection model. To determine whether NanH is required for the Salmonella infection-dependent direction reversal, we constructed and characterized a nanH deletion mutant and found that NanH is partially required for Salmonella infection in primary murine macrophages. However, compared to wild type Salmonella, infection with the nanH mutant only marginally reduced the cathode-oriented macrophage galvonotaxis, without canceling direction reversal. Together, these findings strongly suggest that while neuraminidase-mediated N-glycan modification impaired both macrophage phagocytosis and galvanotaxis, yet to be defined mechanisms other than NanH may play a more important role in bioelectrical control of macrophage trafficking, which potentially triggers dissemination."

This opens the way to understand the heterogeneity of complex multi-signaling networks across cells and cell types, with important implications to understand and treat diseases such as cancer. These technologies are, however, limited to proteins for which antibodies are available and are fairly costly, making predictions of new markers and of existing markers under new conditions a valuable alternative. To assess our capacity to make such predictions and boost further methodological development, we organized the Single Cell Signaling in Breast Cancer DREAM challenge. We used a mass cytometry dataset, covering 36 markers in over 4,000 conditions totaling 80 million single cells across 67 breast cancer cell lines. Through four increasingly difficult subchallenges, the participants predicted missing markers, new conditions, and the time-course response of single cells to stimuli in the presence and absence of kinase inhibitors. The challenge results show that despite the stochastic nature of signal transduction in single cells, the signaling events are tightly controlled and machine learning methods can accurately predict new experimental data."

In contrast, there is a remarkable scarcity of studies investigating the cellular basis of immune function and cytokine changes in psychosis. The few flow-cytometry studies have been limited to counting the proportion of the major classes of monocyte and lymphocytes without distinguishing their pro- and anti-inflammatory subsets. Moreover, most of the investigations are cross-sectional and conducted with patients on long-term medication. These features make it difficult to eliminate confounding of illness-related changes by lifestyle factors, disease duration, and long exposure to antipsychotics. This article focuses on regulatory T cells (Tregs), cornerstone immune cells that regulate innate and adaptive immune forces and neuro-immune interactions between astrocytes and microglia. Tregs are also implicated in cardio-metabolic disorders that are common comorbidities of psychosis. We have recently proposed that Tregs are hypofunctional ('h-Tregs') in psychosis driven by our clinical findings and other independent research. Our h-Treg-glial imbalance hypothesis offers a new account for the co-occurrence of systemic immune dysregulation and mechanisms of psychosis development. This article extends our recent review, the h-Treg hypothesis, to cover new discoveries on Treg-based therapies from pre-clinical findings and their clinical implications. We provide a detailed characterisation of Treg studies in psychosis, identifying important methodological limitations and perspectives for scientific innovation. The outcomes presented in this article reaffirms our proposed h-Treg state in psychosis and reveals emerging preclinical research suggesting the potential benefit of Treg-enhancing therapies. There is a clear need for longitudinal studies conducted with drug-naïve or minimally treated patients using more sophisticated techniques of flow-cytometry, CyTOF expression markers, and in vitro co-culture assays to formally test the suppressive capacity of Tregs. Investment in Treg research offers major potential benefits in targeting emerging immunomodulatory treatment modalities on person-specific immune dysregulations."

Smoking status has been repeatedly confirmed to affect the efficacy of ICIs in NSCLC patients, but the specific mechanism is still unclear. Methods: We performed analysis on the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) clinical NSCLC cohort receiving ICI treatment, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Pan-Lung Cancer cohort, and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database GSE41271 lung cancer cohort that did not receive ICI treatment, including survival prognosis, gene mutation, copy number variation, immunogenicity, and immune microenvironment, and explored the impact of smoking status on the prognosis of NSCLC patients treated with ICIs and possible mechanism. In addition, 8 fresh NSCLC surgical tissue samples were collected for mass cytometry (CyTOF) experiments to further characterize the immune characteristics and verify the mechanism. Result: Through the analysis of the clinical data of the NSCLC cohort treated with ICIs in MSKCC, it was found that the smokers in NSCLC receiving ICI treatment had a longer progression-free survival (HR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.49-0.97, p = 0.031) than those who never smoked. Further analysis of the TCGA and GEO validation cohorts found that the differences in prognosis between different groups may be related to the smoking group's higher immunogenicity, higher gene mutations, and stronger immune microenvironment. The results of the CyTOF experiment further found that the immune microenvironment of smoking group was characterized by higher expression of immune positive regulatory chemokine, and higher abundance of immune activated cells, including follicular helper CD4+ T cells, gamma delta CD4+ T cells, activated DC, and activated CD8+ T cells. In contrast, the immune microenvironment of non-smoking group was significantly enriched for immunosuppressive related cells, including regulatory T cells and M2 macrophages. Finally, we also found highly enriched CD45RAhighCD4+ T cells and CD45RAhighCD8+ T cells in the non-smoking group. Conclusion: Our research results suggest that among NSCLC patients receiving ICI treatment, the stronger immunogenicity and activated immune microenvironment of the smoking group make their prognosis better."

Presently there is a significant drive to gain deeper understanding of cellular and sub-cellular mechanisms of ecotoxicity. Most notable is increased focus on elucidation of cellular-response networks, interactomes, and greater implementation of cell-based biotests using high-throughput procedures, while at the same time decreasing the reliance on standard animal models used in ecotoxicity testing. This is aimed at discovery and interpretation of molecular pathways of ecotoxicity at large scale. In this regard, the applications of cytometry are perhaps one of the most fundamental prospective analytical tools for the next generation and high-throughput ecotoxicology research. The diversity of this modern technology spans flow, laser-scanning, imaging, and more recently, Raman as well as mass cytometry. The cornerstone advantages of cytometry include the possibility of multi-parameter measurements, gating and rapid analysis. Cytometry overcomes, thus, limitations of traditional bulk techniques such as spectrophotometry or gel-based techniques that average the results from pooled cell populations or small model organisms. Novel technologies such as cell imaging in flow, laser scanning cytometry, as well as mass cytometry provide innovative and tremendously powerful capabilities to analyze cells, tissues as well as to perform in situ analysis of small model organisms. In this review, we outline cytometry as a tremendously diverse field that is still vastly underutilized and often largely unknown in environmental sciences. The main motivation of this work is to highlight the potential and wide-reaching applications of cytometry in ecotoxicology, guide environmental scientists in the technological aspects as well as popularize its broader adoption in environmental risk assessment."

These observations suggest that targeting alternative dysregulated signaling pathways may provide therapeutic benefit. Previous studies identified NFκB pathway hyperactivation in myelofibrosis (MF) and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) that was insensitive to JAK2 inhibition. Here, we provide evidence that NFκB pathway inhibition via pevonedistat targets malignant cells in MPN patient samples as well as in MPN and patient-derived xenograft mouse models that are nonredundant with ruxolitinib. Colony forming assays revealed preferential inhibition of MF colony growth compared with normal colony formation. In mass cytometry studies, pevonedistat blunted canonical TNFα responses in MF and sAML patient CD34+ cells. Pevonedistat also inhibited hyperproduction of inflammatory cytokines more effectively than ruxolitinib. Upon pevonedistat treatment alone or in combination with ruxolitinib, MPN mouse models exhibited reduced disease burden and improved survival. These studies demonstrating efficacy of pevonedistat in MPN cells in vitro as well as in vivo provide a rationale for therapeutic inhibition of NFκB signaling for MF treatment. Based on these findings, a Phase 1 clinical trial combining pevonedistat with ruxolitinib has been initiated."

Focusing on the T cell response, we conducted a longitudinal study of infection-naïve and COVID-19 convalescent donors before vaccination and after their first and second vaccine doses, using a high-parameter CyTOF analysis to phenotype their SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. Vaccine-elicited spike-specific T cells responded similarly to stimulation by spike epitopes from the ancestral, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variant strains, both in terms of cell numbers and phenotypes. In infection-naïve individuals, the second dose boosted the quantity and altered the phenotypic properties of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, while in convalescents the second dose changed neither. Spike-specific T cells from convalescent vaccinees differed strikingly from those of infection-naïve vaccinees, with phenotypic features suggesting superior long-term persistence and ability to home to the respiratory tract including the nasopharynx. These results provide reassurance that vaccine-elicited T cells respond robustly to emerging viral variants, confirm that convalescents may not need a second vaccine dose, and suggest that vaccinated convalescents may have more persistent nasopharynx-homing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells compared to their infection-naïve counterparts."

Endometriosis is characterized by growth of endometriosis lesions within the abdominal cavity, generally thought to arise from retrograde menstruation of shed endometrial tissue. While the pathophysiology underlying peritoneal endometriosis lesion formation is still unclear, the interaction between invading endometrial tissue and the peritoneal mesothelial lining is an essential step in lesion formation. In this study, we assessed proteomic differences between eutopic endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) from women with and without endometriosis in response to peritoneal mesothelial cell (PMC) exposure, using single-cell cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF). Co-cultured primary eutopic ESCs from women with and without endometriosis with an established PMC line were subjected to immunostaining with a panel of Maxpar CyTOF metal-conjugated antibodies (n = 28) targeting cell junction and mesenchymal markers, which are involved in cell-cell adhesions and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Exposure of the ESCs to PMCs resulted in a drastic shift in cellular expression profiles in ESCs derived from endometriosis, whereas little effect by PMCs was observed in ESCs from non-endometriosis subjects. The transcription factor SNAI1 was consistently repressed by PMC interactions. ESCs from endometriosis patients are unique in that they respond to PMCs by undergoing changes in adhesive properties and mesenchymal characteristics that would facilitate lesion formation."

Post-depletion immune cell reconstitution may identify relapsing patients, but previous characterizations suffered from methodological limitations of flow cytometry. Time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) is a comprehensive analytic modality that simultaneously quantifies over 40 cellular markers. Herein, we report CyTOF-enabled immune cell comparisons over a 12-month period from 30 children with SDNS receiving B cell depleting therapy who either relapsed (n = 17) or remained stable (n = 13). Anti-CD20 treatment depleted all B cells subsets and CD20 depleting agent choice (rituximab vs ofatumumab) did not affect B cell subset recovery. Despite equal total numbers of B cells, 5 subsets of B cells were significantly higher in relapsing individuals; all identified subsets of B cells were class-switched. T cell subsets (including T follicular helper cells and regulatory T cells) and other major immune compartments were largely unaffected by B cell depletion, and similar between relapsing and stable children. In conclusion, CyTOF analysis of immune cells from anti-CD20 antibody treated patients identifies class-switched B cells as the main subset whose expansion associates with disease relapse. Our findings set the basis for future studies exploring how identified subsets can be used to monitor treatment response and improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease."

Imaging mass cytometry (IMC), a multiplex imaging method recently introduced, can measure up to 100 markers simultaneously in one tissue section by using a high-resolution laser with a mass cytometer. However, due to its high resolution and large number of channels, how to process and interpret the image data from IMC remains a key challenge to its further applications. Accurate and reliable single cell segmentation is the first and a critical step to process IMC image data. Unfortunately, existing segmentation pipelines either produce inaccurate cell segmentation results or require manual annotation, which is very time consuming. Here, we developed Dice-XMBD, a Deep learnIng-based Cell sEgmentation algorithm for tissue multiplexed imaging data.

Large sets of proteins are involved in sensing, stabilizing and repairing this damage including control of cell cycle and proliferation. Some of these factors are phosphorylated upon activation and can be used as biomarkers of DNA damage response (DDR) by flow and mass cytometry. Differential survival rates of lymphocyte subsets in response to DNA damage are well established, characterizing NK cells as most resistant and B cells as most sensitive to DNA damage. We investigated DDR to low dose gamma radiation (2Gy) in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 26 healthy donors and 3 patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT) using mass cytometry. γH2AX, p-CHK2, p-ATM and p53 were analyzed as specific DDR biomarkers for functional readouts of DNA repair efficiency in combination with cell cycle and T, B and NK cell populations characterized by 20 surface markers. We identified significant differences in DDR among lymphocyte populations in healthy individuals. Whereas CD56+CD16+ NK cells showed a strong γH2AX response to low dose ionizing radiation, a reduced response rate could be observed in CD19+CD20+ B cells that was associated with reduced survival. Interestingly, γH2AX induction level correlated inversely with ATM-dependent p-CHK2 and p53 responses. Differential DDR could be further noticed in naïve compared to memory T and B cell subsets, characterized by reduced γH2AX, but increased p53 induction in naïve T cells. In contrast, DDR was abrogated in all lymphocyte populations of AT patients. Our results demonstrate differential DDR capacities in lymphocyte subsets that depend on maturation and correlate inversely with DNA damage-related survival. Importantly, DDR analysis of peripheral blood cells for diagnostic purposes should be stratified to lymphocyte subsets."

The abundance and activation of several leukocyte subsets were investigated with unsupervised clustering approaches FlowSOM and SPADE, as well as by manual gating. Major findings included a proportional increase in CD4+ central memory T cells and an absolute increase in classical monocytes, non-classical monocytes, and mature natural killer cells in type 1 diabetes patients with pain compared to those without pain. The expression of CD27, CD127, and CD39 was upregulated on select T cell populations, and the phosphorylated form of pro-inflammatory transcription factor MK2 was upregulated across most populations. These results provide evidence that distinct immunological signatures are associated with painful neuropathy in type 1 diabetes patients. Further research may link these changes to mechanisms by which pain in type 1 diabetes is initiated and maintained, paving the way for much needed targeted treatments."

Meta-analyses with a specific pHF-W (pHF-W1) confirm a protective effect while other meta-analyses pooling different pHF-W show conflicting results. Here we investigated the molecular composition and functional properties of the specific pHF-W1 as well as the stability of its manufacturing process over time. This specific pHF-W1 was compared with other pHF-Ws. We used size exclusion chromatography to characterize the peptide molecular weight (MW), a rat basophil degranulation assay to assess the relative level of beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) allergenicity and a preclinical model of oral tolerance induction to test prevention of allergic sensitization. To analyze the exact peptide sequences before and after an HLA binding assay, a mass cytometry approach was used. Peptide size allergenicity and oral tolerance induction were conserved across pHF-W1 batches of production and time. The median MW of the 37 samples of pHF-W1 tested was 800 ± 400 Da. Further oral tolerance induction was observed using 10 different batches of the pHF-W1 with a mean reduction of BLG-specific IgE levels of 0.76 log (95% CI = -0.95; -0.57). When comparing pHF-W1 with three other formulas (pHF-W2 3 and 4), peptide size was not necessarily associated with allergenicity reduction in vitro nor oral tolerance induction in vivo as measured by specific IgE level (p < 0.05 for pHF-W1 and 2 and p = 0.271 and p = 0.189 for pHF-W3 and 4 respectively). Peptide composition showed a limited overlap between the formulas tested ranging from 11.7% to 24.2%. Furthermore nine regions in the BLG sequence were identified as binding HLA-DR. In conclusion, not all pHF-Ws tested have the same peptide size distribution decreased allergenicity and ability to induce oral tolerance. Specific peptides are released during the different processes used by different infant formula producers."

Malignant gliomas, the most common primary brain tumors in adults, are genetically heterogeneous and their TME consists of various stromal and immune cells playing an important role in tumor progression and responses to therapies. Previous gene expression or immunocytochemical studies of immune cells infiltrating TME of malignant gliomas failed to dissect their functional phenotypes. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) are powerful techniques allowing quantification of whole transcriptomes or >30 protein targets in individual cells. Both methods provide unprecedented resolution of TME. We summarize the findings from these studies and the current state of knowledge of a functional diversity of immune infiltrates in malignant gliomas with different genetic alterations. A precise definition of functional phenotypes of myeloid and lymphoid cells might be essential for designing effective immunotherapies. Single-cell omics studies have identified crucial cell subpopulations and signaling pathways that promote tumor progression, influence patient survival or make tumors vulnerable to immunotherapy. We anticipate that the widespread usage of single-cell omics would allow rational design of oncoimmunotherapeutics."

The onset and establishment of labor, particularly induced labor, is a complex and dynamic process influenced by multiple endocrine, inflammatory, and mechanical factors as well as obstetric and pharmacological interventions. The duration from labor induction to the onset of active labor remains unpredictable. Moreover, prolonged labor is associated with severe complications for the mother and her offspring, most importantly chorioamnionitis, uterine atony, and postpartum hemorrhage. While maternal immune system adaptations that are critical for the maintenance of a healthy pregnancy have been previously characterized, the role of the immune system during the establishment of labor is poorly understood. Understanding maternal immune adaptations during labor initiation can have important ramifications for predicting successful labor induction and labor complications in both induced and spontaneous types of labor. The aim of this study was to characterize labor-associated maternal immune system dynamics from labor induction to the start of active labor. Serial blood samples from fifteen participants were collected immediately prior to labor induction (baseline) and during the latent phase until the start of active labor. Using high-dimensional mass cytometry, a total of 1,059 single-cell immune features were extracted from each sample. A multivariate machine-learning method was employed to characterize the dynamic changes of the maternal immune system after labor induction until the establishment of active labor. A cross-validated linear sparse regression model (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, LASSO) predicted the minutes since induction of labor with high accuracy (R = 0.86, p = 6.7e-15, RMSE = 277 min). Immune features most informative for the model included STAT5 signaling in central memory CD8+ T cells and pro-inflammatory STAT3 signaling responses across multiple adaptive and innate immune cell subsets. Our study reports a peripheral immune signature of labor induction, and provides important insights into biological mechanisms that may ultimately predict labor induction success as well as complications, thereby facilitating clinical decision-making to improve maternal and fetal well-being."

Deep imputation methods have been proposed to address the related computational challenges (e.g. the gene sparsity in single-cell data). In particular, the neural architectures of those deep imputation models have been proven to be critical for performance. However, deep imputation architectures are difficult to design and tune for those without rich knowledge of deep neural networks and scRNA-seq. Therefore, Surrogate-assisted Evolutionary Deep Imputation Model (SEDIM) is proposed to automatically design the architectures of deep neural networks for imputing gene expression levels in scRNA-seq data without any manual tuning. Moreover, the proposed SEDIM constructs an offline surrogate model, which can accelerate the computational efficiency of the architectural search. Comprehensive studies show that SEDIM significantly improves the imputation and clustering performance compared with other benchmark methods. In addition, we also extensively explore the performance of SEDIM in other contexts and platforms including mass cytometry and metabolic profiling in a comprehensive manner. Marker gene detection, gene ontology enrichment and pathological analysis are conducted to provide novel insights into cell-type identification and the underlying mechanisms.

Epub 2021 Oct 3.,Keywords: anomaly detection; automated quality control; data preprocessing; flow cytometry; mass cytometry; spectral cytometry.,"In cytometry analysis, a large number of markers is measured for thousands or millions of cells, resulting in high-dimensional datasets. During the measurement of these samples, erroneous events can occur such as clogs, speed changes, slow uptake of the sample etc., which can influence the downstream analysis and can even lead to false discoveries. As these issues can be difficult to detect manually, an automated approach is recommended. In order to filter these erroneous events out, we created a novel quality control algorithm, Peak Extraction And Cleaning Oriented Quality Control (PeacoQC), that allows for automated cleaning of cytometry data. The algorithm will determine density peaks per channel on which it will remove low quality events based on their position in the isolation tree and on their mean absolute deviation distance to these density peaks. To evaluate PeacoQC's cleaning capability, it was compared to three other existing quality control algorithms (flowAI, flowClean and flowCut) on a wide variety of datasets. In comparison to the other algorithms, PeacoQC was able to filter out all different types of anomalies in flow, mass and spectral cytometry data, while the other methods struggled with at least one type. In the quantitative comparison, PeacoQC obtained the highest median balanced accuracy and a similar running time compared to the other algorithms while having a better scalability for large files. To ensure that the parameters chosen in the PeacoQC algorithm are robust, the cleaning tool was run on 16 public datasets. After inspection, only one sample was found where the parameters should be further optimized. The other 15 datasets were analyzed correctly indicating a robust parameter choice. Overall, we present a fast and accurate quality control algorithm that outperforms existing tools and ensures high-quality data that can be used for further downstream analysis.

Moreover, disease progression is accompanied by macrophage accumulation in many cancer types and is often associated with poor prognosis and therapy resistance. Given their critical role in modulating tumor immunity in primary and metastatic brain cancers, macrophages are emerging as promising therapeutic targets. Different types of macrophages infiltrate brain cancers, including (i) CNS resident macrophages that comprise microglia (TAM-MG) as well as border-associated macrophages and (ii) monocyte-derived macrophages (TAM-MDM) that are recruited from the periphery. Controversy remained about their disease-associated functions since classical approaches did not reliably distinguish between macrophage subpopulations. Recent conceptual and technological advances, such as large-scale omic approaches, provided new insight into molecular profiles of TAMs based on their cellular origin. In this review, we summarize insight from recent studies highlighting similarities and differences of TAM-MG and TAM-MDM at the molecular level. We will focus on data obtained from RNA sequencing and mass cytometry approaches. Together, this knowledge significantly contributes to our understanding of transcriptional and translational programs that define disease-associated TAM functions. Cross-species meta-analyses will further help to evaluate the translational significance of preclinical findings as part of the effort to identify candidates for macrophage-targeted therapy against brain metastasis."

Multiple biomarkers are reported to identify endogenous tumor-specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), namely CD137, PD-1, CD103, and CD39; however, a direct comparison of these molecules has yet to be performed. We evaluated these biomarkers in primary human ovarian tumor samples using single-cell mass cytometry to compare their relative phenotypic profiles, and examined their response to autologous tumor cells ex vivo. PD-1+ , CD103+ , and CD39+ TILs all contain a CD137+ cell subset, while CD137+ TILs highly co-express the aforementioned markers. CD137+ TILs exhibit the highest expression of cytotoxic effector molecules compared to PD-1+ , CD103+ , or CD39+ TILs. Removal of CD137+ cells from PD-1+ , CD103+ , or CD39+ TILs diminish their IFN-γ secretion in response to autologous tumor cell stimulation, while CD137+ TILs maintain high HLA-dependent IFN-γ secretion. CD137+ TILs exhibited an exhausted phenotype but with CD28 co-expression, suggesting possible receptiveness to reinvigoration via immune checkpoint blockade. Together, our findings demonstrate that the antitumor abilities of PD-1+ , CD103+ , and CD39+ TILs are mainly derived from a subset of CD137-expressing TILs, implicating CD137 as a more selective biomarker for naturally occurring tumor-specific TILs."

The recent revolution of single-cell analysis is substantially transforming our understanding of hematopoiesis, confirming the substantial heterogeneity of cells composing the hematopoietic system. While dynamic molecular changes at the DNA/RNA level underlying hematopoiesis have been extensively explored, a broad understanding of single-cell heterogeneity in hematopoietic signaling programs and landscapes, studied at protein level and reflecting post-transcriptional processing, is still lacking. Here, we accurately quantified the intracellular levels of 9 phosphorylated and 2 functional proteins at the single-cell level to systemically capture the activation dynamics of 8 signaling pathways, including EGFR, Jak/Stat, NF-κB, MAPK/ERK1/2, MAPK/p38, PI3K/Akt, Wnt, and mTOR pathways, during mouse hematopoiesis using mass cytometry."

An elastic net model described the relationship between GA and immunome (R=0.85, p=8.75e-14), and unsupervised clustering highlighted previously unrecognized GA-dependent immune dynamics, including decreasing basal MAP-kinase/NFκB signaling in antigen presenting cells; increasing responsiveness of cytotoxic lymphocytes to interferon-α; and decreasing frequency of regulatory and invariant T cells, including NKT-like cells and CD8+CD161+ T cells.

However, inflammation-mediated tissue alterations underlying the mechanical integrity of the brain remain unclear. We previously showed that blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption visualized by MRI using gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) does not correlate with tissue softening in active experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, it is unknown how confined BBB changes and other inflammatory processes may determine local elasticity changes. Therefore, we aim to elucidate which inflammatory hallmarks are determinant for local viscoelastic changes observed in EAE brains. Hence, novel multifrequency MRE was applied in combination with GBCA-based MRI or very small superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (VSOPs) in female SJL mice with induced adoptive transfer EAE (n = 21). VSOPs were doped with europium (Eu-VSOPs) to facilitate the post-mortem analysis. Accumulation of Eu-VSOPs, which was previously demonstrated to be sensitive to immune cell infiltration and ECM remodeling, was also found to be independent of GBCA enhancement. Following registration to a reference brain atlas, viscoelastic properties of the whole brain and areas visualized by either Gd or VSOP were quantified. MRE revealed marked disseminated softening across the whole brain in mice with established EAE (baseline: 3.1 ± 0.1 m/s vs. EAE: 2.9 ± 0.2 m/s, p < 0.0001). A similar degree of softening was observed in sites of GBCA enhancement i.e., mainly within cerebral cortex and brain stem (baseline: 3.3 ± 0.4 m/s vs. EAE: 3.0 ± 0.5 m/s, p = 0.018). However, locations in which only Eu-VSOP accumulated, mainly in fiber tracts (baseline: 3.0 ± 0.4 m/s vs. EAE: 2.6 ± 0.5 m/s, p = 0.023), softening was more pronounced when compared to non-hypointense areas (percent change of stiffness for Eu-VSOP accumulation: -16.81 ± 16.49% vs. for non-hypointense regions: -5.85 ± 3.81%, p = 0.048). Our findings suggest that multifrequency MRE is sensitive to differentiate between local inflammatory processes with a strong immune cell infiltrate that lead to VSOP accumulation, from disseminated inflammation and BBB leakage visualized by GBCA. These pathological events visualized by Eu-VSOP MRI and MRE may include gliosis, macrophage infiltration, alterations of endothelial matrix components, and/or extracellular matrix remodeling. MRE may therefore represent a promising imaging tool for non-invasive clinical assessment of different pathological aspects of neuroinflammation."

Pembrolizumab, an anti-PD1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, may reverse T-cell exhaustion after CAR T-cell therapy. We treated 12 patients with B-cell lymphomas who were either refractory to (n = 9) or relapsed after (n = 3) CD19-directed CAR T-cell (4-1BB-costimulated) therapy with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks. Median time from CAR T-cell infusion to first pembrolizumab dose was 3.3 months (range, 0.4-42.8 months). Pembrolizumab was well tolerated, and the only grade ≥3 adverse events related to pembrolizumab were neutropenia (n = 3; 25%). Best overall response rate after pembrolizumab was 25% (3 of 12 patients; 1 complete response; 2 partial responses). One (8%) patient had stable disease; thus, 4 of 12 (33%) patients had clinical benefit. After pembrolizumab, 4 patients with clinical benefit had an increase in percentage of CAR T cells by mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF); 3 of 4 of these patients also had increases in CAR19 transgene levels by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Deep immune profiling using CyTOF revealed increased CAR T-cell activation and proliferation and less T-cell exhaustion in clinical responders. Together, PD1 blockade with pembrolizumab after CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy appears safe and may achieve clinical responses in some patients with B-cell lymphomas refractory to or relapsed after CAR T-cell therapy.

In-depth characterization of gluten-specific CD4+ T cells and CeD-associated (CD38+ and CD103+ ) CD8+ and γδ+ T cells in blood of treated CeD patients undergoing a 3 day gluten challenge is reported. The phenotypic profile of gluten-specific cells changes profoundly with gluten exposure and the cells adopt the profile of gluten-specific cells in untreated disease (CD147+ , CD70+ , programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)+ , inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS)+ , CD28+ , CD95+ , CD38+ , and CD161+ ), yet with some markers being unique for day 6 cells (C-X-C chemokine receptor type 6 (CXCR6), CD132, and CD147) and with integrin α4β7, C-C motif chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9), and CXCR3 being expressed stably at baseline and day 6. Among gluten-specific CD4+ T cells, 52% are CXCR5+ at baseline, perhaps indicative of germinal-center reactions, while on day 6 all are CXCR5- . Strikingly, the phenotypic profile of gluten-specific CD4+ T cells on day 6 largely overlaps with that of CeD-associated (CD38+ and CD103+ ) CD8+ and γδ+ T cells. The antigen-induced shift in phenotype of CD4+ T cells being shared with other disease-associated T cells is relevant for development of T-cell-directed therapies."

In vitro, IVIG was a potent activator of neutrophil cell death via PI3K and NADPH oxidase, but independently of caspase activation.CONCLUSIONSActivated neutrophils expressing IL-1β can be targeted by IVIG, supporting its use in both KD and MIS-C to ameliorate inflammation.FUNDINGPatient Centered Outcomes Research Institute; NIH; American Asthma Foundation; American Heart Association; Novo Nordisk Foundation; NIGMS; American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Foundation."

Epub 2021 Aug 31.,Keywords: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; Nivolumab; T lymphocyte; Treatment response.,"Cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has been recognized as a novel therapeutic option for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, only approximately 20-30% of patients with recurrent/metastatic (R/M) HNSCC benefit. Moreover, the mechanisms underlying the response to ICIs remain unclear. We investigated the proportion, activation status, and expression level of immune checkpoint molecules in circulating T cell subsets in R/M HNSCC patients treated with nivolumab using flow cytometry and mass cytometry, and then determined whether treatment response was associated with these values. We also assessed the changes in the frequency of tumor-associated antigens, MAGE-A4 and p53, -specific T cells prior to and after nivolumab treatment using the IFN-γ ELISPOT assay. The proportion of activated CD4+ and CD8+ TEMRA cells significantly increased in the disease-controlled patients but not in disease-progressed patients. As expected, the expression of PD-1 in T cells markedly decreased regardless of the therapeutic response. Meanwhile, T cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 expression on CD8+ T cells was significantly higher in patients with disease progression than in disease-controlled patients after treatment. The frequency of the tumor-associated antigens, MAGE-A4- and p53-specific T cells, was not correlated with clinical responses; however, in the disease-controlled patients, the frequency of MAGE-A4-specific T cells was significantly augmented. We concluded that in R/M HNSCC patients treated with nivolumab, circulating T cells show dynamic alterations depending on treatment efficacy. An analysis of the immunokinetics of circulating T cells could thus provide new insights into rational therapeutic strategies in cancer immunotherapy for HNSCC."

In this study, 23 patients with mild and 22 patients with severe COVID-19 and 6 asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 were enrolled, along with 44 healthy controls (HC). Peripheral immune cells in HC and patients with COVID-19 were comprehensively profiled using mass cytometry. We found that in patients with severe COVID-19, the number of HLA-DRlow/- monocytes was significantly increased, but that of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells was greatly reduced. MAIT cells were highly activated but functionally impaired in response to Escherichia coli and IL-12/IL-18 stimulation in patients with severe COVID-19, especially those with microbial coinfection. Single-cell transcriptome analysis revealed that IFN-stimulated genes were significantly upregulated in peripheral MAIT cells and monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19. IFN-α pretreatment suppressed MAIT cells' response to E. coli by triggering high levels of IL-10 production by HLA-DRlow/--suppressive monocytes. Blocking IFN-α or IL-10 receptors rescued MAIT cell function in patients with severe COVID-19. Moreover, plasma from patients with severe COVID-19 inhibited HLA-DR expression by monocytes through IL-10. These data indicate a unique pattern of immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19, which is characterized by enrichment of suppressive HLA-DRlow/- monocytes associated with functional impairment of MAIT cells through the IFN/IL-10 pathway."

There are multiple cell models of OS described in vitro that express the specific genetic alterations of the sarcoma. In the work reported here, multiple mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) modalities were employed to characterise two aggregated cellular models of OS models formed using the MG63 and SAOS-2 cell lines. Phenotyping of the metabolite activity within the two OS aggregoid models was achieved and a comparison of the metabolite data with OS human tissue samples revealed relevant fatty acid and phospholipid markers. Although, annotations of these species require MS/MS analysis for confident identification of the metabolites. From the putative assignments however, it was suggested that the MG63 aggregoids are an aggressive tumour model that exhibited metastatic-like potential. Alternatively, the SAOS-2 aggregoids are more mature osteoblast-like phenotype that expressed characteristics of cellular differentiation and bone development. It was determined the two OS aggregoid models shared similarities of metabolic behaviour with different regions of OS human tissues, specifically of the higher metastatic grade."

Immune escape through overexpression of PD-L1 in JAK2V617F-mutated MPN provides a rationale for therapeutic PD-1 blockade, and indeed, clinical activity of nivolumab in relapsed MPN post-HSCT has been observed. Elucidation of the features of response following PD-1 blockade in such patients could inform novel therapeutic concepts that enhance GVL. Here, we report an integrated high-dimensional analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing, T-cell receptor sequencing, cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq), and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq), together with mass cytometry, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected at 6 timepoints before, during, and after transient response to PD-1 blockade from an index case of relapsed MPN following HSCT. Before nivolumab infusion, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts demonstrated high expression of chemokines, and T cells were characterized by expression of interferon-response genes. This baseline inflammatory signature disappeared after nivolumab infusion. Clinical response was characterized by transient expansion of a polyclonal CD4+ T-cell population and contraction of an AML subpopulation that exhibited megakaryocytic features and elevated PD-L1 expression. At relapse, the proportion of the AML subpopulation with progenitor-like features progressively increased, suggesting coevolution of AML blasts and donor-derived T cells. We thus demonstrate how single-cell technologies can provide complementary insight into cellular mechanisms underlying response to PD-1 blockade, motivating future longitudinal high-dimensional single-cell studies of GVL responses in relapsed myeloid disease."

To better understand the cause of intestinal symptoms we analyzed biopsies of the small intestine from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Applying qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, we detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA and nucleocapsid protein in duodenal mucosa.

ZIKV infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other severe brain defects in the developing fetus and there have been reports of the occurrence of Guillain-Barré syndrome in areas affected by ZIKV. NK cells are activated during acute viral infections and their activity contributes to a first line of defense because of their ability to rapidly recognize and kill virus-infected cells. To provide insight into NK cell function during ZIKV infection, we have profiled, using mass cytometry, the NK cell receptor-ligand repertoire in a cohort of acute ZIKV-infected female patients. Freshly isolated NK cells from these patients contained distinct, activated, and terminally differentiated, subsets expressing higher levels of CD57, NKG2C, and KIR3DL1 as compared with those from healthy donors. Moreover, KIR3DL1+ NK cells from these patients produced high levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α, in the absence of direct cytotoxicity, in response to in vitro stimulation with autologous, ZIKV-infected, monocyte-derived dendritic cells. In ZIKV-infected patients, overproduction of IFN-γ correlated with STAT-5 activation (r = 0.6643; p = 0.0085) and was mediated following the recognition of MHC class 1-related chain A and chain B molecules expressed by ZIKV-infected monocyte-derived dendritic cells, in synergy with IL-12 production by the latter cells. Together, these findings suggest that NK cells contribute to the generation of an efficacious adaptive anti-ZIKV immune response that could potentially affect the outcome of the disease and/or the development of persistent symptoms."

Understanding this heterogeneity can be especially important for tailoring treatments in a patient-specific manner. Here, we detail methods for preparing human cartilage tissue for profiling via cytometry by time-of-flight (cyTOF). We have previously utilized this method to characterize several rare cell populations in cartilage, including cartilage-progenitor cells, inflammation-amplifying cells (Inf-A), and inflammation-dampening cells (Inf-D). Previous bio-protocols have focused on cyTOF staining of PBMCs. Therefore, here we detail the steps unique to the processing of human cartilage and chondrocytes. Briefly, cartilage tissue is digested to release individual chondrocytes, which can be expanded and manipulated in culture. These cells are then collected and fixed in preparation for cyTOF, followed by standard staining and analysis protocols."

Epub 2021 Aug 13.,Keywords: CyTOF; Female; Gastrointestinal cancer; Hormone; Menopause.,"Postmenopausal women taking estrogen supplements are at a lower risk of advanced colorectal cancer, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Thus, this study examined the role of estrogen in colorectal cancer. Estrogen receptor expression levels in in situ colorectal cancer tissue from female patients increased significantly, indicating their estrogen sensitivity. Compared with the sham-operated group, the growth of MC38 tumors was enhanced in ovariectomized mice, which was reversed in ovariectomized mice with E2 supplementation. The PD-L1+ M2-like macrophage, regulatory T (Treg) cell, and myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) populations significantly increased, and the population of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells declined in MC38 tumors in ovariectomized mice, which were all reversed in ovariectomized mice with E2 supplementation. MC38 cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MC38-EVs), but not EVs derived from MC38 cells treated with E2 (E2-MC38-EVs), were involved in the establishment of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. E2-MC38-EVs contained lower TGF-β1 levels and were less capable of inducing Treg cells than MC38-EVs in vitro. Overall, these results show that estrogen treatment prevents MC38 tumor growth via regulating the tumor immune microenvironment through MC38-EVs."

Using mass cytometry, we analyzed the expression of constitutive transmembrane receptors, adhesion proteins, and platelet activation markers in 12 healthy donors before and at five different time points within 4 weeks after the first BNT162b2 administration. We measured platelet reactivity by stimulating thrombocyte activation with thrombin receptor-activating peptide. Activation marker expression (P-selectin, LAMP-3, LAMP-1, CD40L, and PAC-1) did not change after vaccination. All investigated constitutive transmembrane proteins showed similar expressions over time. Platelet reactivity was not altered after BNT162b2 administration. Activation marker expression was significantly lower compared with an independent cohort of mild symptomatic COVID-19 patients analyzed with the same platform. This study reveals that BNT162b2 administration does not alter platelet protein expression and reactivity."

While evident heterogeneity of resident ATMs has been described previously, their phenotype, developmental origin, and functionality remain inconsistent. We analyzed white adipose tissue (WAT) during homeostasis and diet interventions using comprehensive and unbiased single-cell mass cytometry and genetic lineage tracking models. We now provide a uniform definition of individual subsets of resident ATMs. We show that in lean mice, WAT co-harbors eight kinetically evolving CD206+ macrophage subpopulations (defined by TIM4, CD163, and MHC II) and two CD206- macrophage subpopulations. TIM4-CD163+, TIM4-CD163- and CD206- macrophage populations are largely bone marrow-derived, while the proliferating TIM4+CD163+ subpopulation is of embryonic origin. All macrophage subtypes are active in phagocytosis, endocytosis, and antigen processing in vitro, whereas TIM4+CD163+ cells are superior in scavenging in vivo. A high-fat diet induces massive infiltration of CD206- macrophages and selective down-regulation of MHC II on TIM4+ macrophages. These changes are reversed by dietary intervention. Thus, the developmental origin and environment jointly regulate the functional malleability of resident ATMs."

The purpose of this study was to examine recirculating lymphocytes from SSc patients for potential biomarkers of interstitial lung disease (ILD). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from patients with SSc and healthy controls enrolled in the Vanderbilt University Myositis and Scleroderma Treatment Initiative Center cohort between 9/2017-6/2019. Clinical phenotyping was performed by chart abstraction. Immunophenotyping was performed using both mass cytometry and fluorescence cytometry combined with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding analysis and traditional biaxial gating. This study included 34 patients with SSc-ILD, 14 patients without SSc-ILD, and 25 healthy controls. CD21lo/neg cells are significantly increased in SSc-ILD but not in SSc without ILD (15.4 ± 13.3% vs. 5.8 ± 0.9%, p = 0.002) or healthy controls (5.0 ± 0.5%, p < 0.0001). While CD21lo/neg B cells can be identified from a single biaxial gate, tSNE analysis reveals that the biaxial gate is comprised of multiple distinct subsets, all of which are increased in SSc-ILD. CD21lo/neg cells in both healthy controls and SSc-ILD are predominantly tBET positive and do not have intracellular CD21. Immunohistochemistry staining demonstrated that CD21lo/neg B cells diffusely infiltrate the lung parenchyma of an SSc-ILD patient. Additional work is needed to validate this biomarker in larger cohorts and longitudinal studies and to understand the role of these cells in SSc-ILD."

It is the most important pathological basis of cardiovascular disease and stroke. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are an essential cell type in atherosclerosis. Previous studies have revealed that VSMCs undergo phenotypic transformation in atherosclerosis to participate in the retention of atherogenic lipoproteins as well as the formation of the fibrous cap and the underlying necrotic core in plaques. The emergence of lineage-tracing studies indicates that the function and number of VSMCs in plaques have been greatly underestimated. In addition, recent studies have revealed that VSMCs make up at least 50% of the foam cell population in human and mouse atherosclerotic lesions. Therefore, understanding the formation of lipid-loaded VSMCs and their regulatory mechanisms is critical to elucidate the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and to explore potential therapeutic targets. Moreover, combination of many complementary technologies such as lineage tracing, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), flow cytometry, and mass cytometry (CyTOF) with immunostaining has been performed to further understand the complex VSMC function. Correct identification of detrimental and beneficial processes may reveal successful therapeutic treatments targeting VSMCs and their derivatives during atherosclerosis.

On functionalization with an antibody, the Zr mass tag exhibits specific molecular recognition properties and minimal cross-reaction toward nontargeted cells. In addition, the Zr-mass tag is compatible with MCP mass tags in a multiparameter assay for mouse spleen cells staining, which exploits four additional channels, m/z = 90, 91, 92, 94, for single-cell immunoassays in CyTOF. Compared to the MCP mass tag, the Zr-mass tag provides an additional fivefold signal amplification. This work provides the fundamental technical capability for exploiting NMOF-based mass tags for CyTOF application, which opens up possibility of high-dimensional single-cell immune profiling, low abundant antigen detection, and development of new barcoding systems."

Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a primary immune inhibitory molecule expressed on tumor cells that promotes immune evasion. Here we report ALKBH5 as an important m6A demethylase that orchestrates PD-L1 expression in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Regulation of PD-L1 expression by ALKBH5 was confirmed in human ICC cell lines. Sequencing of the m6A methylome identified PD-L1 mRNA as a direct target of m6A modification whose levels were regulated by ALKBH5. Furthermore, ALKBH5 and PD-L1 mRNA were shown to interact. ALKBH5 deficiency enriched m6A modification in the 3'UTR region of PD-L1 mRNA, thereby promoting its degradation in a YTHDF2-dependent manner. In vitro and in vivo, tumor-intrinsic ALKBH5 inhibited the expansion and cytotoxicity of T cells by sustaining tumor cell PD-L1 expression. The ALKBH5-PD-L1-regulating axis was further confirmed in human ICC specimens. Single-cell mass cytometry analysis unveiled a complex role of ALKBH5 in the tumor immune microenvironment by promoting the expression of PD-L1 on monocytes/macrophages and decreasing the infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor-like cells. Analysis of specimens from patients receiving anti-PD1 immunotherapy suggested that tumors with strong nuclear expression patterns of ALKBH5 are more sensitive to anti-PD1 immunotherapy. Collectively, these results describe a new regulatory mechanism of PD-L1 by mRNA epigenetic modification by ALKBH5 and the potential role of ALKBH5 in immunotherapy response, which might provide insights for cancer immunotherapies. SIGNIFICANCE: This study identifies PD-L1 mRNA as a target of ALKBH5 and reveals a role for ALKBH5 in regulating the tumor immune microenvironment and immunotherapy efficacy."

Using mass cytometry, we chart the stromal composition of 18 murine tissues and 5 spontaneous tumor models, with an emphasis on mesenchymal phenotypes. This analysis reveals extensive stromal heterogeneity across tissues and tumors, and identifies coordinated relationships between mesenchymal and immune cell subsets in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Expression of CD105 demarks two stable and functionally distinct pancreatic fibroblast lineages, which are also identified in murine and human healthy tissues and tumors. Whereas CD105-positive pancreatic fibroblasts are permissive for tumor growth in vivo, CD105-negative fibroblasts are highly tumor suppressive. This restrictive effect is entirely dependent on functional adaptive immunity. Collectively, these results reveal two functionally distinct pancreatic fibroblast lineages and highlight the importance of mesenchymal and immune cell interactions in restricting tumor growth."

We implemented a multimodal analysis approach to elucidate the immune landscape in PDA. Using a combination of CyTOF, single-cell RNA sequencing, and multiplex immunohistochemistry on patient tumors, matched blood, and non-malignant samples, we uncovered a complex network of immune-suppressive cellular interactions. These experiments revealed heterogeneous expression of immune checkpoint receptors in individual patient's T cells and increased markers of CD8+ T cell dysfunction in advanced disease stage. Tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells had an increased proportion of cells expressing an exhausted expression profile that included upregulation of the immune checkpoint TIGIT, a finding that we validated at the protein level. Our findings point to a profound alteration of the immune landscape of tumors, and to patient-specific immune changes that should be taken into account as combination immunotherapy becomes available for pancreatic cancer."

Due to the low frequency of antigen-reactive B cells (<0.05% of lymphocytes) in the periphery, preliminary enrichment of cells is necessary to achieve sufficient numbers for statistically sound characterization, especially when downstream analytic platform use, e.g., CyTOF, is low throughput. We previously described a method to detect and enrich antigen-reactive B cells from peripheral blood and tissues using biotinylated antigens in conjunction with magnetic nanoparticles, preparative to a downstream analysis by ELISPOT and flow cytometry. While mass cytometry (CyTOF) enables high dimensional immunophenotyping of over 40 unique parameters on a single-cell level, its low throughput compared to flow cytometry and requirement for removal of metal contaminants, such as nanoparticles, made it particularly unsuitable for studies of rare cells in a mixed population. Here we describe a novel CyTOF-compatible approach for multiplexed enrichment of antigen-reactive B cells, e.g., insulin and tetanus toxoid, using cleavable magnetic nanoparticles. This method allows improved monitoring of the phenotype and function of antigen-reactive B cells during the development of disease or after immunization while minimizing the amount of sample and run times needed."

Herein, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based metal-phenolic network (MPN) nanocapsules of three sizes (50, 100, and 150 nm) are engineered via supramolecular template-assisted assembly and the effect of the nanocapsule size on bio-nano interactions is investigated using in vitro cell experiments, ex vivo whole blood assays, and in vivo rat models. To track the nanocapsules by mass cytometry, a preformed gold nanoparticle (14 nm) is encapsulated into each PEG-MPN nanocapsule. The results reveal that decreasing the size of the PEG-MPN nanocapsules from 150 to 50 nm leads to reduced association (up to 70%) with phagocytic blood cells in human blood and prolongs in vivo systemic exposure in rat models. The findings provide insights into MPN-based nanocapsules and represent a platform for studying bio-nano interactions."

However, ICB treatments show uneven responses between patients, and neoantigen vaccination efficiency has yet to be established. Here, we characterize neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells in a tumor that is resistant to ICB and neoantigen vaccination. Leveraging the use of mass cytometry combined with multiplex major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I tetramer staining, we screened and identified tumor neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells in the Lewis Lung carcinoma (LLC) tumor model (mRiok1). We observed an expansion of mRiok1-specific CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) after ICB targeting PD-1 or CTLA-4 with no sign of tumor regression. The expanded neoantigen-specific CD8+ TILs remained phenotypically and functionally exhausted but displayed cytotoxic characteristics. When combining both ICB treatments, mRiok1-specific CD8+ TILs showed a stem-like phenotype and a higher capacity to produce cytokines, but tumors did not show signs of regression. Furthermore, combining both ICB treatments with neoantigen vaccination did not induce tumor regression either despite neoantigen-specific CD8+ TIL expansion. Overall, this work provides a model for studying neoantigens in an immunotherapy nonresponder model. We showed that a robust neoantigen-specific T-cell response in the LLC tumor model could fail in tumor response to ICB, which will have important implications in designing future immunotherapeutic strategies."

However, the nature of T cell-mediated viral control mechanisms in life-threatening stages of COVID-19 has yet to be determined. The aim of the present study was to determine the function and phenotype of T cell populations associated with survival or death of patients with COVID-19 in intensive care as a result of phenotypic and functional profiling by mass cytometry. Increased frequencies of circulating, polyfunctional CD4+CXCR5+HLA-DR+ stem cell memory T cells (Tscms) and decreased proportions of granzyme B-expressing and perforin-expressing effector memory T cells were detected in recovered and deceased patients, respectively. The higher abundance of polyfunctional PD-L1+CXCR3+CD8+ effector T cells (Teffs), CXCR5+HLA-DR+ Tscms, and anti-nucleocapsid (anti-NC) cytokine-producing T cells permitted us to differentiate between recovered and deceased patients. The results from a principal component analysis show an imbalance in the T cell compartment that allowed for the separation of recovered and deceased patients. The paucity of circulating PD-L1+CXCR3+CD8+ Teffs and NC-specific CD8+ T cells accurately forecasts fatal disease outcome. This study provides insight into the nature of the T cell populations involved in the control of COVID-19 and therefore might impact T cell-based vaccine designs for this infectious disease."

The proof of concept that targeting inflammation reduces cardiovascular events in patients with a history of myocardial infarction has highlighted the urgent need to identify new immunotherapies to treat patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Importantly, emerging data from new clinical trials show that successful immunotherapies for atherosclerosis need to be tailored to the specific immune alterations in distinct groups of patients. In this Review, we discuss how single-cell technologies - such as single-cell mass cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing and cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing - are ideal for mapping the cellular and molecular composition of human atherosclerotic plaques and how these data can aid in the discovery of new precise immunotherapies. We also argue that single-cell data from studies in humans need to be rigorously validated in relevant experimental models, including rapidly emerging single-cell CRISPR screening technologies and mouse models of atherosclerosis. Finally, we discuss the importance of implementing single-cell immune monitoring tools in early phases of drug development to aid in the precise selection of the target patient population for data-driven translation into randomized clinical trials and the successful translation of new immunotherapies into the clinic."

In total, 496 newly diagnosed FL grade 1-3 A patients who were prospectively enrolled into the MER cohort from 2002 to 2012 were evaluated. Tissue microarrays were stained for CD4, CD8, FOXP3, CD32b, CD14, CD68, CD70, SIRP-α, TIM3, PD-1, and PD-L1. Early failure was defined as failing to achieve event-free survival at 24 months (EFS24) in immunochemotherapy-treated patients and EFS12 in all others. CyTOF and CODEX analysis were performed to characterize intratumoral immunophenotypes. Lack of intrafollicular CD4 expression was the only predictor of early failure that replicated with a pooled OR 2.37 (95%CI 1.48-3.79). We next developed a bio-clinical risk model (BioFLIPI), where lack of CD4 intrafollicular expression moved patients up one FLIPI risk group, adding a new fourth high-risk group. Compared with BioFLIPI score of 1, patients with a score of 2 (OR 2.17; 95% CI 1.08-4.69), 3 (OR 3.53; 95% CI 1.78-7.54), and 4 (OR 8.92; 95% CI 4.00-21.1) had increasing risk of early failure. The favorable intrafollicular CD4 T cells were identified as activated central memory T cells, whose prognostic value was independent from genetic features. In conclusion, lack of intrafollicular CD4 expression predicts early failure in FL and combined with FLIPI improves identification of high-risk patients; however, independent validation is warranted."

Taking leukemia cells as an example, metabolic fingerprints of single leukemia cells were obtained from 472 HL-60, 416 THP-1, 313 U937, 356 Jurkat, and 366 Ramos cells, with throughput up to 40 cells/min. Five leukemia subtypes were clearly distinguished by unsupervised learning t-SNE analysis of the single-cell metabolic fingerprints. Cell discrimination in the mixed leukemia cell samples was also realized by supervised learning of the single-cell metabolic fingerprints with high recovery and good repetition (98.31 ± 0.24%, -102.35 ± 4.82%). Statistical analysis and metabolite assignment were carried out to screen characteristic metabolites for discrimination and 36 metabolites with significant differences were annotated. Then, differentiated metabolites for pairwise discrimination of five leukemia subtypes were further selected as biomarker candidates. Furthermore, discriminating cultured leukemia cells from human normal leukocytes, separated from fresh human peripheral blood, was performed based on single-cell metabolic fingerprints as well as the proposed biomarker candidates, unveiling the potential of this strategy in clinical research. This work makes efforts to realize high-throughput single-leukocyte metabolic analysis and metabolite-based discrimination of leukocytes. It is expected to be a powerful means for the clinical molecular diagnosis of hematological diseases."

We tested our panel in a set of 10 ADCs, classified into long- (LPS) (n = 4) and short-predicted survival (SPS) (n = 6) based on radiomics features. We identified cellular subpopulations of epithelial cancer cells (ECC) and their microenvironment and validated our results by multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) applied to a tissue microarray (TMA) of LPS and SPS ADCs. The antibody panel captured the phenotypical differences in ADC cell lines and PBMC. LPS ADCs had a higher proportion of immune cells. ECC clusters (ECCc) were identified and uncovered two ADC groups. ECCc with high HLA-DR expression were correlated with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with LPS samples being enriched for those clusters. We confirmed a positive correlation between HLA-DR expression on ECC and T cell number by mIF staining on TMA slides. Spatial analysis demonstrated shorter distances from T cells to the nearest ECC in LPS. Our results demonstrate a distinctive cellular profile of ECC and their microenvironment in ADC. We showed that HLA-DR expression in ECC is correlated with T cell infiltration, and that a set of ADCs with high abundance of HLA-DR+ ECCc and T cells is enriched in LPS samples.

Here, we determined how two microbiota-targeted dietary interventions, plant-based fiber and fermented foods, influence the human microbiome and immune system in healthy adults. Using a 17-week randomized, prospective study (n = 18/arm) combined with -omics measurements of microbiome and host, including extensive immune profiling, we found diet-specific effects. The high-fiber diet increased microbiome-encoded glycan-degrading carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) despite stable microbial community diversity. Although cytokine response score (primary outcome) was unchanged, three distinct immunological trajectories in high-fiber consumers corresponded to baseline microbiota diversity. Alternatively, the high-fermented-food diet steadily increased microbiota diversity and decreased inflammatory markers. The data highlight how coupling dietary interventions to deep and longitudinal immune and microbiome profiling can provide individualized and population-wide insight. Fermented foods may be valuable in countering the decreased microbiome diversity and increased inflammation pervasive in industrialized society."

Epub 2021 Jul 9.,Article has no keywords,"Natural killer (NK) cells are a promising cellular therapy for cancer, with challenges in the field including persistence, functional activity, and tumor recognition. Briefly, priming blood NK cells with recombinant human (rh)IL-12, rhIL-15, and rhIL-18 (12/15/18) results in memory-like NK cell differentiation and enhanced responses against cancer. However, the lack of available, scalable Good Manufacturing Process (GMP)-grade reagents required to advance this approach beyond early-phase clinical trials is limiting. To address this challenge, we developed a novel platform centered upon an inert tissue factor scaffold for production of heteromeric fusion protein complexes (HFPC). The first use of this platform combined IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 receptor engagement (HCW9201), and the second adds CD16 engagement (HCW9207). This unique HFPC expression platform was scalable with equivalent protein quality characteristics in small- and GMP-scale production. HCW9201 and HCW9207 stimulated activation and proliferation signals in NK cells, but HCW9207 had decreased IL-18 receptor signaling. RNA sequencing and multidimensional mass cytometry revealed parallels between HCW9201 and 12/15/18. HCW9201 stimulation improved NK cell metabolic fitness and resulted in the DNA methylation remodeling characteristic of memory-like differentiation. HCW9201 and 12/15/18 primed similar increases in short-term and memory-like NK cell cytotoxicity and IFNγ production against leukemia targets, as well as equivalent control of leukemia in NSG mice. Thus, HFPCs represent a protein engineering approach that solves many problems associated with multisignal receptor engagement on immune cells, and HCW9201-primed NK cells can be advanced as an ideal approach for clinical GMP-grade memory-like NK cell production for cancer therapy."

Circumstantial evidence suggests they play important roles in regulating placental development but exactly how they contribute to the successful outcome of pregnancy is still unclear. Uterine ILCs (uILCs) include subsets of tissue-resident natural killer (NK) cells and ILCs, and until recently the phenotype and functions of uILCs were poorly defined. Determining the specific roles of each subset is intrinsically challenging because of the rapidly changing nature of the tissue both during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and high dimensional flow and mass cytometry approaches have recently been used to analyse uILC populations in the uterus in both humans and mice. This detailed characterisation has significantly changed our understanding of the heterogeneity within the uILC compartment. It will also enable key clinical questions to be addressed including whether specific uILC subsets are altered in infertility, miscarriage and pregnancy disorders such as foetal growth restriction and pre-eclampsia. Here, we summarise recent advances in our understanding of the phenotypic and functional diversity of uILCs in non-pregnant endometrium and first trimester decidua, and review how these cells may contribute to successful placental development."

The AITL tumor microenvironment (TME) is unique, featuring a minority population of malignant CD4+ T follicular helper (TFH) cells inter-mixed with a diverse infiltrate of multi-lineage immune cells. While much of the understanding of AITL biology to date has focused on characteristics of the malignant clone, less is known about the many non-malignant populations that comprise the TME. Recently, mutational consistencies have been identified between malignant cells and non-malignant B cells within the AITL TME. As a result, a significant role for non-malignant populations in AITL biology has been increasingly hypothesized. In this study, we have utilized mass cytometry and single-cell transcriptome analysis to identify several expanded populations within the AITL TME. Notably, we find that B cells within the AITL TME feature decreased expression of key markers including CD73 and CXCR5. Furthermore, we describe the expansion of distinct CD8+ T cell populations that feature an exhausted phenotype and an underlying expression profile indicative of dysfunction, impaired cytotoxicity, and upregulation of the chemokines XCL2 and XCL1."

We show that hypercytokinemia in COVID-19 differs from the interferon-gamma-driven cytokine storm in macrophage activation syndrome, and is more pronounced in critical versus mild-moderate COVID-19. Systems modelling of cytokine levels paired with deep-immune profiling shows that classical monocytes drive this hyper-inflammatory phenotype and that a reduction in T-lymphocytes correlates with disease severity, with CD8+ cells being disproportionately affected. Antigen presenting machinery expression is also reduced in critical disease. Furthermore, we report that neutrophils contribute to disease severity and local tissue damage by amplification of hypercytokinemia and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. Together our findings suggest a myeloid-driven immunopathology, in which hyperactivated neutrophils and an ineffective adaptive immune system act as mediators of COVID-19 disease severity."

Thus, searching for new immunotherapy targets is indispensable. NK cells are crucial effectors and regulators in the tumor microenvironment and a determinant of responsiveness to checkpoint inhibitors. We revealed the landscape of NK cell phenotypes in HCC patients to find potential immunotherapy targets. Using single cell mass cytometry, we analyzed 32 surface markers on CD56dim and CD56bright NK cells, which included Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins (Siglecs). We compared peripheral NK cells between HCC patients and healthy volunteers. We also compared NK cells, in terms of their localizations, on an individual patient bases between peripheral and intrahepatic NK cells from cancerous and noncancerous liver tissues. In the HCC patient periphery, CD160+CD56dim NK cells that expressed Siglec-7, NKp46, and NKp30 were reduced, while CD49a+CD56dim NK cells that expressed Siglec-10 were increased. CD160 and CD49a on CD56dim NK cells were significantly correlated to other NK-related markers in HCC patients, which suggested that CD160 and CD49a were signature molecules.

Epub 2021 Jul 10.,Keywords: CyTOF; background removal; imaging mass cytometry; multiplex immunophenotyping.,"Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) allows the detection of multiple antigens (approximately 40 markers) combined with spatial information, making it a unique tool for the evaluation of complex biological systems. Due to its widespread availability and retained tissue morphology, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are often a material of choice for IMC studies. However, antibody performance and signal to noise ratios can differ considerably between FFPE tissues as a consequence of variations in tissue processing, including fixation. In contrast to batch effects caused by differences in the immunodetection procedure, variations in tissue processing are difficult to control. We investigated the effect of immunodetection-related signal intensity fluctuations on IMC analysis and phenotype identification, in a cohort of 12 colorectal cancer tissues. Furthermore, we explored different normalization strategies and propose a workflow to normalize IMC data by semi-automated background removal, using publicly available tools. This workflow can be directly applied to previously acquired datasets and considerably improves the quality of IMC data, thereby supporting the analysis and comparison of multiple samples."

Recently, Deep Clustering has gained popularity due to its flexibility in fitting the specific peculiarities of complex data. Here we introduce the Mixture-of-Experts Similarity Variational Autoencoder (MoE-Sim-VAE), a novel generative clustering model. The model can learn multi-modal distributions of high-dimensional data and use these to generate realistic data with high efficacy and efficiency. MoE-Sim-VAE is based on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), where the decoder consists of a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. This specific architecture allows for various modes of the data to be automatically learned by means of the experts. Additionally, we encourage the lower dimensional latent representation of our model to follow a Gaussian mixture distribution and to accurately represent the similarities between the data points. We assess the performance of our model on the MNIST benchmark data set and challenging real-world tasks of clustering mouse organs from single-cell RNA-sequencing measurements and defining cell subpopulations from mass cytometry (CyTOF) measurements on hundreds of different datasets. MoE-Sim-VAE exhibits superior clustering performance on all these tasks in comparison to the baselines as well as competitor methods."

Epub 2021 Jun 25.,Article has no keywords,"Bead-based assays in flow cytometry are multiplexed analytical techniques that allow rapid and simultaneous detection and quantification of a large number of analytes from small volumes of samples. The development of corresponding bead-based assays in mass cytometry (MC) is highly desirable since it could increase the number of analytes detected in a single assay. The microbeads for these assays have to be labeled with metal isotopes for MC detection. One must also be able to functionalize the bead surface with affinity reagents to capture the analytes. Metal-encoded polystyrene microbeads prepared by multi-stage dispersion polymerization can produce effective isotopic signals in MC with relatively small bead-to-bead variations. However, functionalizing this microbead surface with bioaffinity agents remains challenging, possibly due to the interference of the steric-stabilizing PVP corona on the microbead surface. Here, we report a systematic investigation of a silica coating approach to coat Eu-encoded microbeads with thin silica shells, to functionalize the surface with amino groups, and to introduce bioaffinity agents. We examine the effect of silica shell roughness on the bioconjugation capacity and the effect of silica shell thickness on signal quality in MC measurements. To limit non-specific binding, we converted the amino groups on the microbead surface to carboxylic acid groups. Antibodies were effectively attached to microbead by first conjugating NeutrAvidin to the carboxyl-modified bead surface and then attaching biotinylated antibodies to the NeutrAvidin-modified bead surface. The antibody-modified microbeads can specifically capture antigens, which were marked with isotopic labels, and generate strong signals in MC. These are promising results for the development of bead-based assays in MC."

Epub 2021 Jun 23.,Keywords: Zika virus; dengue virus; ex vivo; immune profiling; mass cytometry; myeloid cells; peripheral blood mononuclear cells.,"Zika and dengue virus (ZIKV and DENV) are two flaviviruses responsible for important vector-borne emerging infectious diseases. While there have been multiple DENV epidemics in the last decades, there have been fewer documented epidemics caused by ZIKV until recent years. Thus, our current knowledge about the biology of ZIKV, the disease, and the immune responses in humans is limited. Here, we used mass cytometry (CyTOF) to perform a detailed characterization of the innate immune responses elicited by ZIKV and DENV in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors infected ex vivo. We found that ZIKV and DENV exposure of human PBMCs induces global phenotypic changes in myeloid cells, characterized mainly by upregulation of costimulatory molecules (CD86 and CD40), CD38, and the type I interferon-inducible protein CD169, a marker for phagocytic function and cross-priming potential in myeloid cells. We also found that ZIKV induces expansion of nonclassical monocytes in cell culture. The analysis of the phenotype of the three monocyte subtypes (classical, intermediate, and nonclassical) at the single-cell level identified differences in their expression of CD86, CD38, CXCL8, and CXCL10 during ZIKV and DENV infection. Overall, using CyTOF, we found that ex vivo infections of PBMCs with ZIKV and DENV reproduced many aspects of the profile found in blood from patients in previously described cohort studies, which highlights the suitability of this system for the study of the human host responses to these viruses. IMPORTANCE Zika and dengue viruses are emergent arboviruses of great public health impact. Both viruses are responsible for important diseases, yet there is currently no vaccine or specific treatment available. Immune cells play critical roles in the virus cycle as well as in the innate and adaptive immune response elicited in the host; therefore, it is critical to understand the changes induced by virus infection in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In this study, we used a model of ex vivo infection of PBMCs and CyTOF technology to profile the early innate immune changes induced by Zika virus and dengue virus in blood."

Breastfeeding guides healthier immune-microbe relationships by providing nutrients to specialized microbes that in turn benefit the host's immune system.

To ensure maximal data quality, a careful experimental and analytical design is required. However even in well-controlled experiments variability caused by either operator or instrument can introduce artifacts that need to be corrected or removed from the data. Here we present a data processing pipeline which ensures the minimization of experimental artifacts and batch effects, while improving data quality. Data preprocessing and quality controls are carried out using an R pipeline and packages like CATALYST for bead-normalization and debarcoding, flowAI and flowCut for signal anomaly cleaning, AOF for files quality control, flowClean and flowDensity for gating, CytoNorm for batch normalization and FlowSOM and UMAP for data exploration. As proper experimental design is key in obtaining good quality events, we also include the sample processing protocol used to generate the data. Both, analysis and experimental pipelines are easy to scale-up, thus the workflow presented here is particularly suitable for large-scale, multicenter, multibatch and retrospective studies."

We highlight that recent advances in transcriptomics analyses have led to thorough characterization of disease-associated microglial states in mice and humans. We then consider the specific scenario of peripheral nerve or tissue injury which induce expression of a specific subset of genes in microglia in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. We suggest the intriguing possibility that future studies may disclose the existence of a unique microglia transcriptional profile that is associated with chronic pain conditions. We also collect evidence that microglial activation in pain-related areas of the brain can be observed in models of neuropathic pain in agreement with recent neuroimaging studies in chronic pain patients. Based on the evidence discussed here, we predict that future studies on the neuroimmune interactions in chronic pain should complement our current understanding of microglia functions, but also adventure in using novel approaches such as scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, CYTOF and transmission electron microscopy to provide a more complete characterization of the function, transcriptome and structure of microglia in chronic pain."

We showed that GSCs, but not normal astrocytes, are sensitive to lysis by healthy allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells in vitro. Mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing of primary tumor samples revealed that GBM tumor-infiltrating NK cells acquired an altered phenotype associated with impaired lytic function relative to matched peripheral blood NK cells from patients with GBM or healthy donors. We attributed this immune evasion tactic to direct cell-to-cell contact between GSCs and NK cells via αv integrin-mediated TGF-β activation. Treatment of GSC-engrafted mice with allogeneic NK cells in combination with inhibitors of integrin or TGF-β signaling or with TGFBR2 gene-edited allogeneic NK cells prevented GSC-induced NK cell dysfunction and tumor growth. These findings reveal an important mechanism of NK cell immune evasion by GSCs and suggest the αv integrin/TGF-β axis as a potentially useful therapeutic target in GBM."

Using high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry, we identified distinct populations of TH1-polarized CD4+ T cells and MBCs expressing the TH1-defining transcription factor T-bet, associated with either increased or reduced risk of Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) malaria, demonstrating that inflammatory responses to malaria are not universally detrimental for infection. Furthermore, we found that, whereas class-switched but not IgM+ MBCs were associated with a reduced risk of symptomatic malaria, populations of TH1 cells with a stem central memory phenotype, TH17 cells, and T regulatory cells were associated with protection from asymptomatic infection, suggesting that activation of cell-mediated immunity might also be required to control persistent P. vivax infection with low parasite burden."

Immune profiling of samples obtained from patients with central nervous system malignancies using techniques such as mass cytometry and single-cell sequencing along with experimental data from genetically engineered mouse models have revealed fundamental differences in immune composition and immunobiology that not only explain the differences in responsiveness to these agents but also lay the foundations for immunotherapeutic strategies that are applicable to gliomas.

Sample pooling after prior surface staining termed live-cell barcoding is more desirable than intracellular barcoding, where samples are pooled after fixation and permeabilization, since it does not depend on fixation-sensitive antigenic epitopes. In live-cell barcoding, the general approach uses two tags per sample out of a pool of antibodies paired with five palladium (Pd) isotopes in order to preserve appreciable signal-to-noise ratios and achieve higher yields after sample deconvolution. The number of samples that can be pooled in an experiment using live-cell barcoding is limited, due to weak signal intensities associated with Pd isotopes and the relatively low number of available tags. Here, we describe a novel barcoding technique utilizing 10 different tags, seven cadmium (Cd) tags and three Pd tags, with superior signal intensities that do not impinge on lanthanide detection, which enables enhanced pooling of samples with multiple experimental conditions and markedly enhances sample throughput."

We employed a high-dimensional mass cytometry approach to characterize over 250 cell-specific functional responses in 18 innate and adaptive immune cell subsets exposed to 1G or simulated (s)µG using the Rotating Wall Vessel. A statistically stringent elastic net method produced a multivariate model that accurately stratified immune responses observed in 1G and sµG (p value 2E-4, cross-validation). Aspects of our analysis resonated with prior knowledge of human immune adaptations to µG, including the dampening of Natural Killer, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Remarkably, we found that sµG enhanced STAT5 signaling responses of immunosuppressive Tregs. Our results suggest µG exerts a dual effect on the human immune system, simultaneously dampening cytotoxic responses while enhancing Treg function.

While traditional animal models have been effective, a better understanding of the response in humans to new vaccines in pre-clinical development is critical for advancement to clinical trials. A translational methodology that can capture the complexity of a vaccine-driven response in a human model, which does not require human exposure, is needed. Here we have designed a platform that uses fresh human whole blood as a key component to study the adaptive immune memory response to vaccine formulations. The response is monitored by high-parameter single cell analysis using mass cytometry (Helios, CyTOF System), allowing for a rapid, in-depth characterization of antigen specific proliferation and expansion of preexisting memory T cells in concert with an innate adjuvant-driven response. In this work we demonstrate the capability of this platform to characterize biologically relevant changes in the cellular response across memory T-cells, B cells, monocytes, and NK cells, at an unprecedented level of detail.

Inhibition of the macrophage scavenger receptor Clever-1 has shown benefit in inducing CD8+ T-cell-mediated antitumor responses in mouse models of cancer, which supports the clinical development of Clever-1-targeting antibodies for cancer treatment."

We delineated the phenotypic and functional defects in NK cells from high-risk patients with B/T-ALL using mass cytometry, flow cytometry, and in silico cytometry, with the goal of further elucidating the role of NK cells in sustaining acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) regression. We found that, compared with their normal counterparts, NK cells from patients with B/T-ALL are less cytotoxic but exhibit an activated signature that is characterized by high CD56, high CD69, production of activated NK cell-origin cytokines, and calcium (Ca2+) signaling. We demonstrated that defective maturation of NK cells into cytotoxic effectors prevents NK cells from ALL from lysing NK cell-sensitive targets as efficiently as do normal NK cells. Additionally, we showed that NK cells in ALL are exhausted, which is likely caused by their chronic activation. We found that increased frequencies of activated cytokine-producing NK cells are associated with increased disease severity and independently predict poor clinical outcome in patients with ALL. Our studies highlight the benefits of developing NK cell profiling as a diagnostic tool to predict clinical outcome in patients with ALL and underscore the clinical potential of allogeneic NK cell infusions to prevent ALL recurrence."

KCNK3 is expressed in several cell and tissue types on both membrane and endoplasmic reticulum and potentially plays a role in multiple pathological process associated with PAH. However, the role of various stressors driving the susceptibility of KCNK3 mutation to PAH is unknown. Hence, we exposed kcnk3fl/fl animals to hypoxia, metabolic diet and low dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and performed molecular characterization of their tissue. We also used tissue samples from KCNK3 patients (skin fibroblast derived inducible pluripotent stem cells, blood, lungs, peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and performed microarray, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and mass cytometry time of flight (CyTOF) experiments. Although a hypoxic insult did not alter vascular tone in kcnk3fl/fl mice, RNASeq study of these lungs implied that inflammatory and metabolic factors were altered, and the follow-up diet study demonstrated a dysregulation of bone marrow cells in kcnk3fl/fl mice. Finally, a low dose LPS study clearly showed that inflammation could be a possible second hit driving PAH in kcnk3fl/fl mice. Multiplex, IHC and CyTOF immunophenotyping studies on human samples confirmed the mouse data and strongly indicated that cell mediated, and innate immune responses may drive PAH susceptibility in these patients. In conclusion, loss of function KCNK3 mutation alters various physiological processes from vascular tone to metabolic diet through inflammation. Our data suggests that altered circulating immune cells may drive PAH susceptibility in patients with KCNK3 mutation."

A unique population of TBET+EOMES+ CD4+ T cells was associated with individuals with COVID-19 who experienced moderate, rather than severe or lethal, disease. Disease severity correlated with blood creatinine and urea nitrogen levels. Proteomics revealed a major impact of age on the disease-associated plasma signatures and highlighted the divergent contribution of hepatocyte and muscle secretomes to COVID-19 plasma proteins. Aging plasma was enriched in matrisome proteins and heart/aorta smooth muscle cell-specific proteins. These findings reveal age-specific and disease-specific changes associated with COVID-19, and potential soluble mediators of the physiological impact of COVID-19."

Proteomics can make a decisive contribution to achieving this goal as it brings together a range of technologies that potentially allow the expression levels of thousands of proteins to be analyzed at the same time. In the first part of this chapter, after an overview of the main mechanisms that determine T-cell dysfunction, new MS-based approaches to characterizing T-cell subpopulations in the tumor microenvironment will be described. The second part of the chapter will focus on the main strategies for cancer immunotherapy, from the selective blockage of inhibitory receptor to CAR T therapy. Examples of proteomics application to tumor microenvironment analysis will be reported to illustrate how these innovative approaches can contribute significantly to understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate an effective response to therapy."

Leukemic blasts have a negative impact on NK cell function and promote the emergence of phenotypically and functionally impaired NK cells. In the current work, we highlight an accumulation of CD56-CD16+ unconventional NK cells in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), an aberrant subset initially described as being elevated in patients chronically infected with HIV-1. Deep phenotyping of NK cells was performed using peripheral blood from patients with newly diagnosed AML (n = 48, HEMATOBIO cohort, NCT02320656) and healthy subjects (n = 18) by mass cytometry. We showed evidence of a moderate to drastic accumulation of CD56-CD16+ unconventional NK cells in 27% of patients. These NK cells displayed decreased expression of NKG2A as well as the triggering receptors NKp30 and NKp46, in line with previous observations in HIV-infected patients. High-dimensional characterization of these NK cells highlighted a decreased expression of three additional major triggering receptors required for NK cell activation, NKG2D, DNAM-1, and CD96. A high proportion of CD56-CD16+ NK cells at diagnosis was associated with an adverse clinical outcome and decreased overall survival (HR = 0.13; P = 0.0002) and event-free survival (HR = 0.33; P = 0.018) and retained statistical significance in multivariate analysis. Pseudotime analysis of the NK cell compartment highlighted a disruption of the maturation process, with a bifurcation from conventional NK cells toward CD56-CD16+ NK cells. Overall, our data suggest that the accumulation of CD56-CD16+ NK cells may be the consequence of immune escape from innate immunity during AML progression."

PDAC is characterized by an extensive fibroinflammatory stroma that includes abundant infiltrating immune cells. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are prevalent within the stroma and are key drivers of immunosuppression. TAMs in human and murine PDAC are characterized by elevated expression of apolipoprotein E (ApoE), an apolipoprotein that mediates cholesterol metabolism and has known roles in cardiovascular and Alzheimer's disease but no known role in PDAC. We report here that ApoE is also elevated in peripheral blood monocytes in PDAC patients, and plasma ApoE protein levels stratify patient survival. Orthotopic implantation of mouse PDAC cells into syngeneic wild-type or in ApoE-/- mice showed reduced tumor growth in ApoE-/- mice. Histologic and mass cytometric (CyTOF) analysis of these tumors showed an increase in CD8+ T cells in tumors in ApoE-/- mice. Mechanistically, ApoE induced pancreatic tumor cell expression of Cxcl1 and Cxcl5, known immunosuppressive factors, through LDL receptor and NF-κB signaling. Taken together, this study reveals a novel immunosuppressive role of ApoE in the PDAC microenvironment. SIGNIFICANCE: This study shows that elevated apolipoprotein E in PDAC mediates immune suppression and high serum apolipoprotein E levels correlate with poor patient survival.See related commentary by Sherman, p. 4186."

Based on the effect of sex hormones on breast tumorigenesis and prognosis, as well as on the development of breast cancer metastases, modification of the steroid skeleton is a hotspot of research for novel anticancer agents. Numerous recent studies support that minor modifications of the androstane skeleton yield potent antiproliferative and antimetastatic drug candidates. The aim of the present study was to assess the antitumor and antimetastatic properties, as well as the mechanism of action of a D-ring-modified exo-heterocyclic androstadiene derivative named 17APAD. The test compound was found to be highly selective towards human breast cancer-derived cell lines (MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-231) compared to non-cancerous fibroblast cells (NIH/3T3), and exerted superior effect compared to the clinically applied reference drug cisplatin. Changes in MCF-7- and MDA-MB-231 cell morphology and membrane integrity induced by the test substance were assessed by fluorescent double staining. Cell cycle disturbances were analyzed by flow cytometry, and concentration-dependent alterations were detected on breast cancer cell lines. Mitochondrial apoptosis induced by the test compound was demonstrated by JC-1 staining. Inhibitory effects on metastasis formation, including the inhibition of migration, invasion and intravasation were investigated in 2D and 3D models. Significant anti-migratory and anti-invasive effects on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were detected after 24 h exposure in 2D wound healing and Boyden-chamber assays. The anti-intravasative properties of 17APAD were evident after 4 h of incubation in a co-culture 3D circular chemorepellent-induced defects (CCID) assay, and the level of inhibition at concentrations ≥2 µM was comparable to that exerted by the focal adhesion kinase inhibitor defactinib. Single cell mass cytometry revealed that chemosensitive subpopulations of MDA-MB-231 cells engaged to apoptosis were less positive for EGFR, CD274, and CD326, while the percentage of cells positive for GLUT1, MCT4, Pan-Keratin, CD66(a,c,e), Galectin-3 and TMEM45A increased in response to 17APAD treatment. Finally, the novel androstane analogue 17APAD had an outstanding inhibitory effect on tumour growth in the 4T1 orthotopic murine breast cancer model in vivo after 2 weeks of intraperitoneal administration. These findings support that substitution of the androsta-5,16-diene framework with a N-containing heterocyclic moiety at C17 position yields a molecular entity rational to be considered for design and synthesis of novel, effective antitumor agents, and 17APAD is worth further investigation as a promising anticancer drug candidate."

In this study, we performed an exploratory analysis of blood immune response profiles in healthy controls and MS patients sampled at their first neurological relapse, using two large CyTOF panels including 62 markers exploring myeloid and lymphoid cells. An increased abundance of both a T-bet-expressing B cell subset and a CD206+ classical monocyte subset was detected in the blood of early MS patients. Moreover, T-bet-expressing B cells tended to be enriched in aggressive MS patients. This study provides new insights into understanding the pathophysiology of MS and the identification of immunological biomarkers.

Focusing on the T cell response, we conducted a longitudinal study of infection-naïve and COVID-19 convalescent donors before vaccination and after their first and second vaccine doses, using a high-parameter CyTOF analysis to phenotype their SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. Vaccine-elicited spike-specific T cells responded similarly to stimulation by spike epitopes from the ancestral, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variant strains, both in terms of cell numbers and phenotypes. In infection-naïve individuals, the second dose boosted the quantity and altered the phenotypic properties of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, while in convalescents the second dose changed neither. Spike-specific T cells from convalescent vaccinees differed strikingly from those of infection-naïve vaccinees, with phenotypic features suggesting superior long-term persistence and ability to home to the respiratory tract including the nasopharynx. These results provide reassurance that vaccine-elicited T cells respond robustly to emerging viral variants, confirm that convalescents may not need a second vaccine dose, and suggest that vaccinated convalescents may have more persistent nasopharynx-homing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells compared to their infection-naïve counterparts."

Herein, we provide a systematic insight into the effect of the chain length of poly(oligo (ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate) (POEGMEA) containing polyethylene glycol on the colloidal stability and antibody-conjugation efficiency of nanoparticles. We employed Reversible Addition-Fragmentation Chain Transfer (RAFT) to design diblock copolymers composed of 7 monoacryloxyethyl phosphate (MAEP) units and 6, 13, 35, or 55 OEGMEA units. We find that when the POEGMEA chain is short, the polymer cannot effectively stabilize the nanoparticles, and when the POEGMEA chain is long, the nanoparticles cannot be efficiently conjugated to antibody. In other words, the majority of the carboxylic groups in larger POEGMEA chains are inaccessible to further chemical modification. We demonstrate that the polymer containing 13 OEGMEA units can effectively bind up to 64% of the antibody molecules, while the binding efficiency drops to 50% and 0% for the polymer containing 35 and 55 OEGMEA units. Moreover, flow cytometry assay statistically shows that about 9% of the coupled antibody retained its activity to recognize B220 biomarkers on the B cells.

L-Tellurienylalanine (TePhe) is an analogue of the proteinogenic amino acid L-phenylalanine (Phe) in which the phenyl side chain has been replaced by a 5-membered tellurophene moiety. High incorporation level of TePhe in expressed proteins at defined sites is expected to facilitate studies in proteomics, protein NMR spectroscopy, and structure elucidation. As a model we chose immunoglobulin-binding Protein G, B1 domain (GB1) to validate TePhe as a suitable structural analogue for Phe. We demonstrate that approximately 1 in 2 of all Phe sites within GB1 can be substituted with TePhe through expression in standard non-Phe-auxotrophic E. coli in Phe-deficient media containing glyphosate, an inhibitor of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. The TePhe content of the GB1 sample can be further increased to 85 % through HPLC. Using NMR and CD spectroscopy, we confirm that the Phe-to-TePhe substitution has negligible impact on the global structure and stability of GB1."

Neutrophils in the TME acquire a complement-dependent T-cell suppressor phenotype that is characterized by inhibition of T-cell proliferation and activation through mechanisms distinct from those of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. In this study, we used ascites fluid supernatants (ASC) from patients with ovarian cancer as an authentic component of the TME to evaluate the effects of ASC on neutrophil function and mechanisms for neutrophil-driven immune suppression. ASC prolonged neutrophil life span, decreased neutrophil density, and induced nuclear hypersegmentation. Mass cytometry analysis showed that ASC induced 15 distinct neutrophil clusters. ASC stimulated complement deposition and signaling in neutrophils, resulting in surface mobilization of granule constituents, including NADPH oxidase. NADPH oxidase activation and phosphatidylserine signaling were required for neutrophil suppressor function, although we did not observe a direct role of extracellular reactive oxygen species in inhibiting T-cell proliferation. Postoperative surgical drainage fluid also induced a complement-dependent neutrophil suppressor phenotype, pointing to this effect as a general response to injury. Like circulating lymphocytes, ASC-activated neutrophils caused complement-dependent suppression of tumor-associated lymphocytes. ASC-activated neutrophils adhered to T cells and caused trogocytosis of T-cell membranes. These injury and signaling cues resulted in T-cell immunoparalysis characterized by impaired NFAT translocation, IL2 production, glucose uptake, mitochondrial function, and mTOR activation. Our results demonstrate that complement-dependent priming of neutrophil effector functions in the TME induces a T-cell nonresponsiveness distinct from established checkpoint pathways and identify targets for immunotherapy.See related Spotlight by Cassatella, p. 725."

Our results show that although intracellular and extracellularly bound AgNPs undergo major transformation depending on their primary size and surface coating, intracellular Ag in 24 h AgNP-exposed human lymphocytes exists in nanoparticulate form. Biotransformation of AgNPs is dominated by sulfidation, which can be viewed as one of the cellular detoxification pathways for Ag. These results also show that the toxicity of AgNPs is primarily driven by internalized Ag. In fact, when toxicity thresholds are expressed as the intracellular mass of Ag per cell, differences in toxicity between NPs of different coatings and sizes are minimized. The analytical approach developed here has broad applicability in different systems where the aim is to understand and quantify cell-NP interactions and biotransformation."

Interactions between immune cells and other stromal cells within the involuting mammary gland are fundamental in facilitating an aggressive tumor phenotype. The MNK1/2-eIF4E axis promotes translation of prometastatic mRNAs in tumor cells, but its role in modulating the function of nontumor cells in the PPBC microenvironment has not been explored. Here, we used a combination of in vivo PPBC models and in vitro assays to study the effects of inactivation of the MNK1/2-eIF4E axis on the protumor function of select cells of the tumor microenvironment. PPBC mice deficient for phospho-eIF4E (eIF4ES209A) were protected against lung metastasis and exhibited differences in the tumor and lung immune microenvironment compared with wild-type mice. Moreover, the expression of fibroblast-derived IL33, an alarmin known to induce invasion, was repressed upon MNK1/2-eIF4E axis inhibition. Imaging mass cytometry on PPBC and non-PPBC patient samples indicated that human PPBC contains phospho-eIF4E high-expressing tumor cells and CD8+ T cells displaying markers of an activated dysfunctional phenotype. Finally, inhibition of MNK1/2 combined with anti-PD-1 therapy blocked lung metastasis of PPBC. These findings implicate the involvement of the MNK1/2-eIF4E axis during PPBC metastasis and suggest a promising immunomodulatory route to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy by blocking phospho-eIF4E.

To investigate MM and its immune environment, we apply single cell RNA and linked-read whole genome sequencing to profile 29 longitudinal samples at different disease stages from 14 patients. Here, we collect 17,267 plasma cells and 57,719 immune cells, discovering patient-specific plasma cell profiles and immune cell expression changes. Patients with the same genetic alterations tend to have both plasma cells and immune cells clustered together. By integrating bulk genomics and single cell mapping, we track plasma cell subpopulations across disease stages and find three patterns: stability (from precancer to diagnosis), and gain or loss (from diagnosis to relapse). In multiple patients, we detect ""B cell-featured"" plasma cell subpopulations that cluster closely with B cells, implicating their cell of origin. We validate AP-1 complex differential expression (JUN and FOS) in plasma cell subpopulations using CyTOF-based protein assays, and integrated analysis of single-cell RNA and CyTOF data reveals AP-1 downstream targets (IL6 and IL1B) potentially leading to inflammation regulation.

Nevertheless, the immune mechanisms induced in vivo by vaccination are still unclear. The route of administration, an important vaccination parameter, can substantially modify the quality of the response. How the route of administration affects the generation and profile of immune responses is of major interest. Here, we aimed to extensively characterize the profiles of the innate and adaptive response to vaccination induced after intradermal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular administration with a modified vaccinia virus Ankara model vaccine in non-human primates. The adaptive response following subcutaneous immunization was clearly different from that following intradermal or intramuscular immunization. The subcutaneous route induced a higher level of neutralizing antibodies than the intradermal and intramuscular vaccination routes. In contrast, polyfunctional CD8+ T-cell responses were preferentially induced after intradermal or intramuscular injection. We observed the same dichotomy when analyzing the early molecular and cellular immune events, highlighting the recruitment of cell populations, such as CD8+ T lymphocytes and myeloid-derived suppressive cells, and the activation of key immunomodulatory gene pathways. These results demonstrate that the quality of the vaccine response induced by an attenuated vaccine is shaped by early and subtle modifications of the innate immune response. In this immunization context, the route of administration must be tailored to the desired type of protective immune response. This will be achieved through systems vaccinology and mathematical modeling, which will be critical for predicting the efficacy of the vaccination route for personalized medicine."

When the dose of immunosuppressant is too low, graft rejection occurs easily, while a dose that is too high can lead to graft loss. Therefore, it is very important to explore the immune status of patients receiving immunosuppressive agents after kidney transplantation. To compare the immune status of the recipient's whole peripheral blood before and after receipt of immunosuppressive agents, we used single-cell cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) to detect the peripheral blood immune cells in five kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) from the Department of Organ Transplantation of Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University before and after receiving immunosuppressive agents. Based on CyTOF analysis, we detected 363,342 live single immune cells. We found that the immune cell types of the KTRs before and after receipt of immunosuppressive agents were mainly divided into CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, NK cells/γδ T cells, monocytes/macrophages, granulocytes, and dendritic cells (DCs). After further reclustering of the above cell types, it was found that the immune cell subclusters in the peripheral blood of patients underwent major changes after receipt of immunosuppressants. After receiving immunosuppressive therapy, the peripheral blood of KTRs had significantly increased levels of CD57+NK cells and significantly decreased levels of central memory CD4+ T cells, follicular helper CD4+ T cells, effector CD8+ T cells, effector memory CD8+ T cells and naive CD8+ T cells. This study used CyTOF to classify immune cells in the peripheral blood of KTRs before and after immunosuppressive treatment, further compared differences in the proportions of the main immune cell types and immune cell subgroups before and after receipt of immunosuppressants, and provided relatively accurate information for assessment and treatment strategies for KTRs."

Here, we illustrated the use of data integration and visualization tools generally used in the business sector to analyze datasets generated by mass and flow cytometry. We selected a study that used mass cytometry to characterize immune cells in lung adenocarcinoma and a second study that used flow cytometry to characterize the expression signature of CD markers on human immune cells.

However, current estimations are inaccurate. As pregnancy progresses toward labor, major transitions occur in fetomaternal immune, metabolic, and endocrine systems that culminate in birth. The comprehensive characterization of maternal biology that precedes labor is key to understanding these physiological transitions and identifying predictive biomarkers of delivery. Here, a longitudinal study was conducted in 63 women who went into labor spontaneously. More than 7000 plasma analytes and peripheral immune cell responses were analyzed using untargeted mass spectrometry, aptamer-based proteomic technology, and single-cell mass cytometry in serial blood samples collected during the last 100 days of pregnancy. The high-dimensional dataset was integrated into a multiomic model that predicted the time to spontaneous labor [R = 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.79 to 0.89], P = 1.2 × 10-40, N = 53, training set; R = 0.81, 95% CI [0.61 to 0.91], P = 3.9 × 10-7, N = 10, independent test set]. Coordinated alterations in maternal metabolome, proteome, and immunome marked a molecular shift from pregnancy maintenance to prelabor biology 2 to 4 weeks before delivery. A surge in steroid hormone metabolites and interleukin-1 receptor type 4 that preceded labor coincided with a switch from immune activation to regulation of inflammatory responses. Our study lays the groundwork for developing blood-based methods for predicting the day of labor, anchored in mechanisms shared in preterm and term pregnancies."

We conducted 38- parameter CyTOF phenotyping on tetramer-identified Nuc 322-331 -specific CD8+ T cells, and on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells recognizing the entire nucleocapsid and spike proteins from SARS- CoV-2, and took 32 serological measurements on longitudinal specimens from this participant.

Nuc 322-331 -specific CD8+ T cells were predominantly central memory T cells, but continually evolved over a ∼6-month period of convalescence. We observed a slow and progressive decrease in the activation state and polyfunctionality of the Nuc 322-331 -specific CD8+ T cells, accompanied by an increase in their lymph-node homing and homeostatic proliferation potential. These results suggest that following a typical case of mild COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells not only persist but continuously differentiate in a coordinated fashion well into convalescence, into a state characteristic of long-lived, self-renewing memory."

In humans, homozygous or compound heterozygous deletions in DOCK8 cause a combined immunodeficiency characterized by various allergic diseases including food allergies. Although group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) contribute to the development of allergic inflammation by producing interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-13, the role of ILC2s in DOCK8 deficiency has not been fully explored. With the use of cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF), we performed high-dimensional phenotyping of intestinal immune cells and found that DOCK8-deficient (Dock8-/-) mice exhibited expansion of ILC2s and other leukocytes associated with type 2 immunity in the small intestine. Moreover, IL-5- and IL-13-producing cells markedly increased in Dock8-/- mice, and the majority of them were lineage-negative cells, most likely ILC2s. Intestinal ILC2s expanded when DOCK8 expression was selectively deleted in hematopoietic cells. Importantly, intestinal ILC2 expansion was also observed in Dock8VAGR mice having mutations in the catalytic center of DOCK8, thereby failing to activate Cdc42. Our findings indicate that DOCK8 is a negative regulator of intestinal ILC2s to inhibit their expansion via Cdc42 activation, and that deletion of DOCK8 causes a skewing to type 2 immunity in the gut."

Cancer vaccine works to induce T cell priming, expansion, and infiltration resulting in antigen-specific cytotoxicity. Such an approach that can drive cytotoxicity within the tumor could complement the success of checkpoint inhibitors as tumors shown to have high immune cell infiltration are those that would respond well to these antibodies. With the advancements in cancer vaccine, methods to monitor and understand how cancer vaccines modify the immune milieu is under rapid development. This includes using ELISpot and intracellular staining to detect cytokine secretion by activated T cells; tetramer and CyTOF to quantitate the level of antigen specific T cells; proliferation and cell killing assay to detect the expansion of T cell and specific killing activity. More recently, T cell profiling has provided unprecedented detail on immune cell subsets and providing clues to the mechanism involved in immune activation.

As current immunotherapies confer negligible survival benefits, there is a need to better characterise leukocytes in pancreatic cancer to identify better therapeutic strategies. In this study, we analysed 32 human pancreatic cancer patients from two independent cohorts. A multi-parameter mass-cytometry analysis was performed on 32,000 T-cells from eight patients. Single-cell RNA sequencing dataset analysis was performed on a cohort of 24 patients. Multiplex immunohistochemistry imaging and spatial analysis were performed to map immune infiltration into the tumour microenvironment. Regulatory T-cell populations demonstrated highly immunosuppressive states with high TIGIT, ICOS and CD39 expression. CD8+ T-cells were found to be either in senescence or an exhausted state. The exhausted CD8 T-cells had low PD-1 expression but high TIGIT and CD39 expression. These findings were corroborated in an independent pancreatic cancer single-cell RNA dataset. These data suggest that T-cells are major players in the suppressive microenvironment of pancreatic cancer. Our work identifies multiple novel therapeutic targets that should form the basis for rational design of a new generation of clinical trials in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma."

By applying bioinformatics analysis to mass cytometry (CyTOF)-phenotyped specimens from individuals with viremia and in-vitro-infected cells from uninfected donors, we provide an atlas of the phenotypes of in vivo and in vitro HIV-susceptible cells. T helper 17 (Th17) and α4β1+ cells are preferentially targeted in vivo, whereas T effector memory (Tem), T transitional memory (Ttm), Th1, and Th1/Th17 subsets are targeted in vitro. Multiple proteins-including chemokine and cytokine receptors-are remodeled by HIV in vivo, and these changes are mostly recapitulated in vitro. HIV remodels cells to a T follicular helper (Tfh) phenotype. Using clustering, we uncover a subset of CD29-expressing, Tem-like cells that are highly susceptible to infection in vivo and in vitro and experimentally confirm that susceptibility.

Also located in the niche are a second subset of macrophages, namely bone marrow-derived macrophages (BM Mφ). We previously reported that a subpopulation of OM co-express both CD166 and CSF1R, the receptor for macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF), and that OM form more bone-resorbing osteoclasts than BM Mφ. Reported here are single-cell quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), mass cytometry (CyTOF), and marker-specific functional studies that further identify differences between OM and BM Mφ from neonatal C57Bl/6 mice. Although OM express higher levels of CSF1R and MCSF, they do not respond to MCSF-induced proliferation, in contrast to BM Mφ. Moreover, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), without the addition of MCSF, was sufficient to induce osteoclast formation in OM but not BM Mφ cultures. OM express higher levels of CD166 than BM Mφ, and we found that osteoclast formation by CD166-/- OM was reduced compared with wild-type (WT) OM, whereas CD166-/- BM Mφ showed enhanced osteoclast formation. CD110/c-Mpl, the receptor for thrombopoietin (TPO), was also higher in OM, but TPO did not alter OM-derived osteoclast formation, whereas TPO stimulated BM Mφ osteoclast formation. CyTOF analyses demonstrated OM uniquely co-express CD86 and CD206, markers of M1 and M2 polarized macrophages, respectively. OM performed equivalent phagocytosis in response to LPS or IL-4/IL-10, which induce polarization to M1 and M2 subtypes, respectively, whereas BM Mφ were less competent at phagocytosis when polarized to the M2 subtype. Moreover, in contrast to BM Mφ, LPS treatment of OM led to the upregulation of CD80, an M1 marker, as well as IL-10 and IL-6, known anti-inflammatory cytokines. Overall, these data reveal that OM and BM Mφ are distinct subgroups of macrophages, whose phenotypic and functional differences in proliferation, phagocytosis, and osteoclast formation may contribute physiological specificity during health and disease. © 2021 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR)."

In synergy with constantly adapting new single-cell analysis approaches and subsequent accumulating big data collections from these platforms, whole atlases of cell types and cellular and sub-cellular interaction networks are created. These atlases build an ideal scientific discovery environment for reference and data mining approaches, which often times reveals new cellular disease networks.

We will touch on how pre-print platforms help in optimization and reproducibility of workflows, as well as community outreach. We will also shortly discuss how leveraging single cell multi-omic approaches can be used to accelerate cellular biomarker discovery during clinical trials to predict response to therapy, follow responsive cell types, and define novel druggable target pathways.

Applying mass cytometry and machine learning to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells, we find that corticosteroid-resistant asthma patients cluster largely into two groups: one enriched in interleukin (IL)-4+ innate immune cells and another dominated by interferon (IFN)-γ+ T cells, including tissue-resident memory cells. In contrast, BAL cells of a healthier population are enriched in IL-10+ macrophages. To better understand cellular mediators of severe asthma, we developed the Immune Cell Linkage through Exploratory Matrices (ICLite) algorithm to perform deconvolution of bulk RNA sequencing of mixed-cell populations.

Yet, contemporary clustering and dimensionality reduction tools alone are insufficient to analyze or reproduce analyses across large numbers of samples, batches, or experiments. Moreover, approaches that allow for the integration of data across batches or experiments are not well incorporated into computational toolkits to allow for streamlined workflows. Here we present Spectre, an R package that enables comprehensive end-to-end integration and analysis of HD cytometry data from different batches or experiments. Spectre streamlines the analytical stages of raw data pre-processing, batch alignment, data integration, clustering, dimensionality reduction, visualization, and population labelling, as well as quantitative and statistical analysis. Critically, the fundamental data structures used within Spectre, along with the implementation of machine learning classifiers, allow for the scalable analysis of very large HD datasets, generated by flow cytometry, mass cytometry, or spectral cytometry. Using open and flexible data structures, Spectre can also be used to analyze data generated by single-cell RNA sequencing or HD imaging technologies, such as Imaging Mass Cytometry. The simple, clear, and modular design of analysis workflows allow these tools to be used by bioinformaticians and laboratory scientists alike. Spectre is available as an R package or Docker container. R code is available on Github (https://github.com/immunedynamics/spectre)."

Cytotoxic function of NK cells is compromised in patients with SLE. Herein, we characterized the phenotypic alterations of SLE NK cells in a comprehensive manner to further delineate the mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic dysfunction of SLE NK cells and identify novel potential therapeutic targets. Therefore, we examined PBMC from SLE patients and matched healthy controls by single-cell mass cytometry to assess the phenotype of NK cells. In addition, we evaluated the cell function of NK cells (degranulation and cytokine production) and the killing of B cell subpopulations in a B cell-NK cell in vitro co-culture model. We found that SLE NK cells expressed higher levels of CD38 and were not able to adequately upregulate SLAMF1 and SLAMF7 following activation. In addition, ligation of SLAMF7 with elotuzumab or of CD38 with daratumumab on SLE NK cells enhanced degranulation of both healthy and SLE NK cells and primed them to kill circulating plasma cells in an in vitro co-culture system. Overall, our data indicated that dysregulated expression of CD38, SLAMF1 and SLAMF7 on SLE NK cells is associated with an altered interplay between SLE NK cells and plasma cells, thus suggesting their contribution to the accumulation of (auto)antibody producing cells. Accordingly, targeting SLAMF7 and CD38 may represent novel therapeutic approaches in SLE by enhancing NK cell function and promoting elimination of circulating plasma cell."

Epub 2021 Apr 5.,Article has no keywords,"Increasing evidence has demonstrated that cells are individually heterogeneous. Advancing the technologies for single-cell analysis will improve our ability to characterize cells, study cell biology, design and screen drugs, and aid cancer diagnosis and treatment. Most current single-cell protein analysis approaches are based on fluorescent antibody-binding technology. However, this technology is limited by high background and cross-talk of multiple tags introduced by fluorescent labels. Stable isotope labels used in mass cytometry can overcome the spectral overlap of fluorophores. Nevertheless, the specificity of each antibody and heavy-metal-tagged antibody combination must be carefully validated to ensure detection of the intended target. Thus, novel single-cell protein analysis methods without using labels are urgently needed. Moreover, the labeling approach targets already known motifs, hampering the discovery of new biomarkers relevant to single-cell population variation. Here, we report a combined microfluidic and matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometric approach for the analysis of protein biomarkers suitable for small cell ensembles. All necessary steps for cell analysis including cell lysis, protein capture, and digestion as well as MALDI matrix deposition are integrated on a microfluidic chip prior to the downstream MALDI-time-of-flight (TOF) detection. For proof of principle, this combined method is used to assess the amount of Bcl-2, an apoptosis regulator, in metastatic breast cancer cells (MCF-7) by using an isotope-labeled peptide as an internal standard. The proposed approach will eventually provide a new means for proteome studies in small cell ensembles with the potential for single-cell analysis and improve our ability in disease diagnosis, drug discovery, and personalized therapy."

Microglia rapidly react to the changes in their microenvironment. This plasticity is attributed to the ability of microglia to adapt a context-specific phenotype. Numerous gene expression profiling studies of immunosorted CNS immune cells did not permit a clear dissection of their phenotypes, particularly in diseases when peripheral cells of the immune system come to play. Only recent advances in single-cell technologies allowed studying microglia at high resolution and revealed a spectrum of discrete states both under homeostatic and pathological conditions. Single-cell technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and mass cytometry (Cytometry by Time-Of-Flight, CyTOF) enabled determining entire transcriptomes or the simultaneous quantification of >30 cellular parameters of thousands of individual cells.

We present an approach for parallel single-object identification of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and tumor-derived large extracellular vesicles (LEVs) based on automated high-resolution immunofluorescence followed by downstream multiplexed protein profiling. Identification of LEVs >6 µm in size and CTC enumeration was highly correlated, with LEVs being 1.9 times as frequent as CTCs, and additional LEVs were identified in 73% of CTC-negative liquid biopsy samples from metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) revealed that 49% of cytokeratin (CK)-positive LEVs and CTCs were EpCAM-negative, while frequently carrying prostate cancer tumor markers including AR, PSA, and PSMA. HSPD1 was shown to be a specific biomarker for tumor derived circulating cells and LEVs. CTCs and LEVs could be discriminated based on size, morphology, DNA load and protein score but not by protein signatures. Protein profiles were overall heterogeneous, and clusters could be identified across object classes. Parallel analysis of CTCs and LEVs confers increased sensitivity for liquid biopsies and expanded specificity with downstream characterization.

Skeletal muscle regeneration is driven by the muscle satellite cells, the stem cell population in interaction with their niche. Upon injury, muscle fibers undergo necrosis and muscle stem cells activate, proliferate and fuse to form new myofibers. In addition to myogenic cell populations, interaction with other cell types such as inflammatory cells, mesenchymal (fibroadipogenic progenitors-FAPs, pericytes) and vascular (endothelial) lineages are important for efficient muscle repair. While the role of the distinct populations involved in skeletal muscle regeneration is well characterized, the quantitative changes in the muscle stem cell and niche during the regeneration process remain poorly characterized. Methods: We have used mass cytometry to follow the main muscle cell types (muscle stem cells, vascular, mesenchymal and immune cell lineages) during early activation and over the course of muscle regeneration at D0, D2, D5 and D7 compared with uninjured muscles. Results: Early activation induces a number of rapid changes in the proteome of multiple cell types. Following the induction of damage, we observe a drastic loss of myogenic, vascular and mesenchymal cell lineages while immune cells invade the damaged tissue to clear debris and promote muscle repair. Immune cells constitute up to 80% of the mononuclear cells 5 days post-injury. We show that muscle stem cells are quickly activated in order to form new myofibers and reconstitute the quiescent muscle stem cell pool. In addition, our study provides a quantitative analysis of the various myogenic populations during muscle repair. Conclusions: We have developed a mass cytometry panel to investigate the dynamic nature of muscle regeneration at a single-cell level. Using our panel, we have identified early changes in the proteome of stressed satellite and niche cells. We have also quantified changes in the major cell types of skeletal muscle during regeneration and analyzed myogenic transcription factor expression in satellite cells throughout this process. Our results highlight the progressive dynamic shifts in cell populations and the distinct states of muscle stem cells adopted during skeletal muscle regeneration. Our findings give a deeper understanding of the cellular and molecular aspects of muscle regeneration."

Responses to currently available FLT3 inhibitors in AML patients are typically transient and followed by disease recurrence. Thus, FLT3 inhibitors with new inhibitory mechanisms are needed to improve therapeutic outcomes. AMG925 is a novel, potent, small-molecule dual inhibitor of FLT3 and CDK4/6. In this study. we determined the antileukemic effects and mechanisms of action of AMG925 in AML cell lines and primary samples, in particular AML stem/progenitor cells. AMG925 inhibited cell growth and promoted apoptosis in AML cells with or without FLT3 mutations. Reverse-phase protein array profiling confirmed its on-target effects on FLT3-CDK4/6-regulated pathways and identified unrevealed signaling network alterations in AML blasts and stem/progenitor cells in response to AMG925. Mass cytometry identified pathways that may confer resistance to AMG925 in phenotypically defined AML stem/progenitor cells and demonstrated that combined blockade of FLT3-CDK4/6 and AKT/mTOR signaling facilitated stem cell death. Our findings provide a rationale for the mechanism-based inhibition of FLT3-CDK4/6 and for combinatorial approaches to improve the efficacy of FLT3 inhibition in both FLT3 wild-type and FLT3-mutated AML."

In this study, we included 58 patients undergoing upfront ASCT and evaluated their cellular and humoral iTME with cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) and luminex, respectively, at day +60 to 100 post-ASCT. We identified 2 cellular iTME patterns. Group 1 was enriched in T-cell subsets at the opposite ends of the spectrum of T-cell differentiation compared with the rest of the patients, that is, cells already terminally differentiated (immune senescent or exhausted) and naive T cells. This group had worse hematologic responses post-ASCT, inferior survival, and shorter time to hematologic progression independent of established risk factors. No differences in the humoral iTME were noted between the 2 groups. In addition, no differences in the cellular/humoral iTME were noted according to high-risk fluorescence in situ hybridization status, early or late relapse. Finally, males had higher levels of natural killer cells negative for CD16, a key receptor mediating antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity, a major mechanism of antitumor efficacy by therapeutic antibodies such as elotuzumab. Our findings suggest that T-cell iTME dysfunction post-ASCT, some of which could be reversible (exhaustion), correlates with worse outcomes.

However, a thorough investigation of the interplay between infected cells and the immune system at sites of infection has been lacking. Here we use high-parameter imaging mass cytometry9 that targets the expression of 36 proteins to investigate the cellular composition and spatial architecture of acute lung injury in humans (including injuries derived from SARS-CoV-2 infection) at single-cell resolution. These spatially resolved single-cell data unravel the disordered structure of the infected and injured lung, alongside the distribution of extensive immune infiltration. Neutrophil and macrophage infiltration are hallmarks of bacterial pneumonia and COVID-19, respectively. We provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infects predominantly alveolar epithelial cells and induces a localized hyperinflammatory cell state that is associated with lung damage. We leverage the temporal range of fatal outcomes of COVID-19 in relation to the onset of symptoms, which reveals increased macrophage extravasation and increased numbers of mesenchymal cells and fibroblasts concomitant with increased proximity between these cell types as the disease progresses-possibly as a result of attempts to repair the damaged lung tissue. Our data enable us to develop a biologically interpretable landscape of lung pathology from a structural, immunological and clinical standpoint. We use this landscape to characterize the pathophysiology of the human lung from its macroscopic presentation to the single-cell level, which provides an important basis for understanding COVID-19 and lung pathology in general."

This strategy allows spatially-resolved multiplexing of dozens of simultaneous protein targets with 1μm resolution. Each slide is a spatial assay consisting of high-dimensional multivariate observations (m-dimensional feature space) collected at different spatial positions and capturing data from a single biological sample or even representative spots from multiple samples when using tissue microarrays. Often, each of these spatial assays could be characterized by several regions of interest (ROIs). To extract meaningful information from the multi-dimensional observations recorded at different ROIs across different assays, we propose to analyze such datasets using a two-step graph-based approach. We first construct for each ROI a graph representing the interactions between the m covariates and compute an m dimensional vector characterizing the steady state distribution among features. We then use all these m-dimensional vectors to construct a graph between the ROIs from all assays. This second graph is subjected to a nonlinear dimension reduction analysis, retrieving the intrinsic geometric representation of the ROIs. Such a representation provides the foundation for efficient and accurate organization of the different ROIs that correlates with their phenotypes. Theoretically, we show that when the ROIs have a particular bi-modal distribution, the new representation gives rise to a better distinction between the two modalities compared to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator. We applied our method to predict the sensitivity to PD-1 axis blockers treatment of lung cancer subjects based on IMC data, achieving 97.3% average accuracy on two IMC datasets. This serves as empirical evidence that the graph of graphs approach enables us to integrate multiple ROIs and the intra-relationships between the features at each ROI, giving rise to an informative representation that is strongly associated with the phenotypic state of the entire image."

Using mass cytometry to profile 46 different markers on individual immune cells, we systematically initially confirmed the presence of increased CD11c+ B cells in the blood of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. Notably, significant differences in the expression of CD21, CD27, and CD38 became apparent between CD11c- and CD11c+ B cells. We observed direct correlation of the frequency of CD21-CD27- B cells and CD21-CD38- B cells with CD11c+ B cells, which were most pronounced in SLE compared to primary Sjögren's syndrome patients (pSS) and healthy donors (HD). Thus, CD11c+ B cells resided mainly within memory subsets and were enriched in CD27-IgD-, CD21-CD27-, and CD21-CD38- B cell phenotypes. CD11c+ B cells from all donor groups (SLE, pSS, and HD) showed enhanced CD69, Ki-67, CD45RO, CD45RA, and CD19 expression, whereas the membrane expression of CXCR5 and CD21 were diminished. Notably, SLE CD11c+ B cells showed enhanced expression of the checkpoint molecules CD86, PD1, PDL1, CD137, VISTA, and CTLA-4 compared to HD. The substantial increase of CD11c+ B cells with a CD21- phenotype co-expressing distinct activation and checkpoint markers, points to a quantitative increased alternate (extrafollicular) B cell activation route possibly related to abnormal immune regulation as seen under the striking inflammatory conditions of SLE which shows a characteristic PD-1/PD-L1 upregulation."

Immunotherapy has been approved for treating HCC, but biomarker-based stratification of patients for optimal response to therapy is an unmet need6,7. Here we report the progressive accumulation of exhausted, unconventionally activated CD8+PD1+ T cells in NASH-affected livers. In preclinical models of NASH-induced HCC, therapeutic immunotherapy targeted at programmed death-1 (PD1) expanded activated CD8+PD1+ T cells within tumours but did not lead to tumour regression, which indicates that tumour immune surveillance was impaired. When given prophylactically, anti-PD1 treatment led to an increase in the incidence of NASH-HCC and in the number and size of tumour nodules, which correlated with increased hepatic CD8+PD1+CXCR6+, TOX+, and TNF+ T cells. The increase in HCC triggered by anti-PD1 treatment was prevented by depletion of CD8+ T cells or TNF neutralization, suggesting that CD8+ T cells help to induce NASH-HCC, rather than invigorating or executing immune surveillance. We found similar phenotypic and functional profiles in hepatic CD8+PD1+ T cells from humans with NAFLD or NASH. A meta-analysis of three randomized phase III clinical trials that tested inhibitors of PDL1 (programmed death-ligand 1) or PD1 in more than 1,600 patients with advanced HCC revealed that immune therapy did not improve survival in patients with non-viral HCC. In two additional cohorts, patients with NASH-driven HCC who received anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 treatment showed reduced overall survival compared to patients with other aetiologies. Collectively, these data show that non-viral HCC, and particularly NASH-HCC, might be less responsive to immunotherapy, probably owing to NASH-related aberrant T cell activation causing tissue damage that leads to impaired immune surveillance. Our data provide a rationale for stratification of patients with HCC according to underlying aetiology in studies of immunotherapy as a primary or adjuvant treatment."

Here, taking SARS-CoV-2 as a model, we explored the antiviral properties and immune-profile of a large panel of four highly stable and well-characterized MXenes - Ti3C2Tx, Ta4C3T x , Mo2Ti2C3T x and Nb4C3T x . To start with antiviral assessment, we first selected and deeply analyzed four different SARS-CoV-2 genotypes, common in most countries and carrying the wild type or mutated spike protein. When inhibition of the viral infection was tested in vitro with four viral clades, Ti3C2T x in particular, was able to significantly reduce infection only in SARS-CoV-2/clade GR infected Vero E6 cells. This difference in the antiviral activity, among the four viral particles tested, highlights the importance of considering the viral genotypes and mutations while testing antiviral activity of potential drugs and nanomaterials. Among the other MXenes tested, Mo2Ti2C3T x also showed antiviral properties. Proteomic, functional annotation analysis and comparison to the already published SARS-CoV-2 protein interaction map revealed that MXene-treatment exerts specific inhibitory mechanisms. Envisaging future antiviral MXene-based drug nano-formulations and considering the central importance of the immune response to viral infections, the immune impact of MXenes was evaluated on human primary immune cells by flow cytometry and single-cell mass cytometry on 17 distinct immune subpopulations. Moreover, 40 secreted cytokines were analyzed by Luminex technology. MXene immune profiling revealed i) the excellent bio and immune compatibility of the material, as well as the ability of MXene ii) to inhibit monocytes and iii) to reduce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect elicited by MXene. We here report a selection of MXenes and viral SARS-CoV-2 genotypes/mutations, a series of the computational, structural and molecular data depicting deeply the SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of inhibition, as well as high dimensional single-cell immune-MXene profiling.

Imaging mass cytometry (IMC), which combines IHC using metal-labeled antibodies with laser ablation and detection using mass cytometry by time-of-flight, overcomes this limitation with the capability to simultaneously analyze up to 40 protein markers to generate high-dimensional images from a single tissue section. IMC analysis preserves tissue architecture and spatial cellular relationships that would otherwise be lost or significantly altered in applications requiring tissue dissociation, such as flow cytometry or single-cell RNA sequencing. Resulting high-dimensional histological images permit spatially conserved analysis to identify unique cell populations, cellular interactions and avoidances, and insight into activation and behavioral status based on tissue location. IMC can be performed on both frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue, allowing for previously banked samples to be analyzed and correlated with known clinical outcomes.

By transducing α and β chains of the expanded clonotypes into a TCR-defective cell line, we confirmed that those cells were drug specific. Collectively, these results suggest that the relative clonal expansion and phenotype of skin-recruited CTLs condition the clinical presentation of cutaneous adverse drug reactions."

Flow cytometry has emerged as a critically important platform due to its high-throughput capability and its ability to simultaneously measure multiple parameters in the same sample. However, to assure the confidence in measurement, well characterized biological reference materials are needed for standardizing clinical assays and harmonizing flow cytometric results between laboratories. To date, the lack of adequate reference materials, and the complexity of the cytometer instrumentation have resulted in few standards. This study was designed to evaluate CD19 expression in three potential biological cell reference materials and provide a preliminary assessment of their suitability to support future development of CD19 reference standards. Three commercially available human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from three different manufacturers were tested. Variables that could potentially contribute to the differences in the CD19 expression, such as PBMCs manufacturing process, number of healthy donors used in manufacturing each PBMC lot, antibody reagent, operators, and experimental days were included in our evaluation. CD19 antibodies bound per cell (ABC) values were measured using two flow cytometry-based quantification schemes with two independent calibration methods, a single point calibration using a CD4 reference cell and QuantiBrite PE bead calibration. Three lots of PBMC from three different manufacturers were obtained. Each lot of PBMC was tested on three different experimental days by three operators using three different lots of unimolar anti-CD19PE conjugates. CD19 ABC values were obtained in parallel on a selected lot of the PBMC samples using mass spectrometry (CyTOF) with two independent calibration methods, EQ4 and bead-based calibration were evaluated with CyTOF-technology. Including all studied variabilities such as PBMC lot, antibody reagent lot, and operator, the averaged mean values of CD19 ABC for the three PBMC manufacturers (A,B, and C) obtained by flow cytometry were found to be: 7953 with a %CV of 9.0 for PBMC-A, 10535 with a %CV of 7.8 for PBMC-B, and 12384 with a %CV of 16 for PBMC-C. These CD19 ABC values agree closely with the findings using CyTOF. The averaged mean values of CD19 ABC for the tested PBMCs is 9295 using flow cytometry-based method and 9699 using CyTOF. The relative contributions from various sources of uncertainty in CD19 ABC values were quantified for the flow cytometry-based measurement scheme. This uncertainty analysis suggests that the number of antigens or ligand binding sites per cell in each PBMC preparation is the largest source of variability. On the other hand, the calibration method does not add significant uncertainty to the expression estimates. Our preliminary assessment showed the suitability of the tested materials to serve as PBMC-based CD19+ reference control materials for use in quantifying relevant B cell markers in B cell lymphoproliferative disorders and immunotherapy. However, users should consider the variabilities resulting from different lots of PBMC and antibody reagent when utilizing cell-based reference materials for quantification purposes and perform bridging studies to ensure harmonization between the results before switching to a new lot."

To assess the reproducibility of this observation, we piloted an approach to administer ramucirumab/paclitaxel after ICI in more patients, and explored changes in the immune microenvironment. Nineteen consecutive patients with mGEA received ICI followed by ramucirumab/paclitaxel. Most (95%) did not respond to ICI, yet after irRECIST-defined progression on ICI, all patients experienced tumor size reduction on ramucirumab/paclitaxel. The objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) on ramucirumab/paclitaxel after ICI were higher than on the last chemotherapy before ICI in the same group of patients (ORR, 58.8% vs 11.8%; PFS 12.2 vs 3.0 months; respectively). Paired tumor biopsies examined by imaging mass cytometry showed a median 5.5-fold (range 4-121) lower frequency of immunosuppressive forkhead box P3+ regulatory T cells with relatively preserved CD8+ T cells, post-treatment versus pre-treatment (n = 5 pairs). We then compared the outcomes of these 19 patients with a separate group who received ramucirumab/paclitaxel without preceding ICI (n = 68). Median overall survival on ramucirumab/paclitaxel was longer with (vs without) immediately preceding ICI (14.8 vs 7.4 months) including after multivariate analysis, as was PFS. In our small clinical series, outcomes appeared improved on anti-VEGFR-2/paclitaxel treatment when preceded by ICI, in association with alterations in the immune microenvironment. However, further investigation is needed to determine the generalizability of these data. Prospective clinical trials to evaluate sequential treatment with ICI followed by anti-VEGF(R)/taxane are underway."

These serine proteases comprise cathepsin G (CatG), neutrophil elastase protease 3 (PR3), and neutrophil serine protease 4 (NSP4). A disadvantage of the uncontrolled proteolytic activity of proteases is the outcome of various human diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, thrombosis, and autoimmune diseases. Activity-based probes (ABPs) are used to determine the proteolytic activity of proteases, containing a set of three essential elements: Warhead, recognition sequence, and the reporter tag for detection of the covalent enzyme activity-based probe complex. Here, we summarize the latest findings of ABP-mediated detection of proteases in both locations intracellularly and on the cell surface of cells, thereby focusing on CatG. Particularly, application of ABPs in regular flow cytometry, imaging flow cytometry, and mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) approaches is advantageous when distinguishing between immune cell subsets. ABPs can be included in a vast panel of markers to detect proteolytic activity and determine whether proteases are properly regulated during medication. The use of ABPs as a detection tool opens the possibility to interfere with uncontrolled proteolytic activity of proteases by employing protease inhibitors."

Here, we comprehensively determined GPA33 expression patterns on human blood leukocyte subsets, using mass and flow cytometry. We found that GPA33 was expressed on fractions of B, dendritic, natural killer and innate lymphoid cells. Most prominent expression was found in the CD4+ T cell compartment. Naïve and CXCR5+ regulatory T cells were GPA33high , and naïve conventional CD4+ T cells expressed intermediate GPA33 levels. The expression pattern of GPA33 identified functional heterogeneity within the CD4+ central memory T cell (Tcm) population. GPA33+ CD4+ Tcm cells were fully undifferentiated, bona fide Tcm cells that lack immediate effector function, whereas GPA33- Tcm cells exhibited rapid effector functions and may represent an early stage of differentiation into effector/effector memory T cells before loss of CD62L. Expression of GPA33 in conventional CD4+ T cells suggests a role in localization and/or preservation of an undifferentiated state. These results form a basis to study the function of GPA33 and show it to be a useful marker to discriminate between different cellular subsets, especially in the CD4+ T cell lineage."

Typically, single-cell datasets from different technologies cannot be directly combined or concatenated, due to the innate difference in the data, such as the number of measured parameters and the distributions. Even datasets generated by the same technology are often affected by the batch effect. A computational approach for aligning different datasets and hence identifying related clusters will be useful for data integration and interpretation in large scale single-cell experiments. Our proposed algorithm called JSOM, a variation of the Self-organizing map, aligns two related datasets that contain similar clusters, by constructing two maps-low-dimensional discretized representation of datasets-that jointly evolve according to both datasets. Here we applied the JSOM algorithm to flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. The resulting JSOM maps not only align the related clusters in the two datasets but also preserve the topology of the datasets so that the maps could be used for further analysis, such as clustering."

Even though a majority of the population develops only minor symptoms upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, a significant number are hospitalized at intensive care units (ICU) requiring critical care. While insights into the early stages of the disease are rapidly expanding, the dynamic immunological processes occurring in critically ill patients throughout their recovery at ICU are far less understood. Here, we have analysed whole blood samples serially collected from 40 surviving COVID-19 patients throughout their recovery in ICU using high-dimensional cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) and cytokine multiplexing. Based on the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), we defined four sequential immunotypes during recovery that correlated to various clinical parameters, including the level of respiratory support at concomitant sampling times. We identified classical monocytes as the first immune cell type to recover by restoration of HLA-DR-positivity and the reduction of immunosuppressive CD163 + monocytes, followed by the recovery of CD8 + and CD4 + T cell and non-classical monocyte populations. The identified immunotypes also correlated to aberrant cytokine and acute-phase reactant levels. Finally, integrative analysis of cytokines and immune cell profiles showed a shift from an initially dysregulated immune response to a more coordinated immunogenic interplay, highlighting the importance of longitudinal sampling to understand the pathophysiology underlying recovery from severe COVID-19."

We interrogated CD8+ T cell activation in vitro and in response to Listeria monocytogenes infection in vivo. This approach revealed a distinct metabolic state in early-activated T cells characterized by maximal expression of glycolytic and oxidative metabolic proteins. Cells in this transient state were most abundant 5 days post-infection before rapidly decreasing metabolic protein expression. Analogous findings were observed in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells interrogated longitudinally in advanced lymphoma patients.

Natural killer (NK) cells have been shown to protect against liver fibrosis and tumorigenesis, suggesting that they may also play a role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) are a family of inhibitory and activating receptors expressed by many cell types, including NK cells. Here, we investigated the phenotypic profiles of peripheral blood and intrahepatic NK cells, including expression of Siglecs and immune checkpoint molecules, and their association with NK cell function in patients with NAFLD. Immune cells in the peripheral blood of 42 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and 13 healthy volunteers (HVs) were identified by mass cytometry. The function of various NK cell subpopulations was assessed by flow cytometric detection of intracellular IFN-γ and CD107a/LAMP-1, a degranulation marker, after in vitro stimulation. We found that peripheral blood from NAFLD patients, regardless of fibrosis stage, contained significantly fewer total CD56+ NK cell and CD56dim NK cell populations compared with HVs, and the CD56dim cells from NAFLD patients were functionally impaired. Among the Siglecs examined, NK cells predominantly expressed Siglec-7 and Siglec-9, and both the expression levels of Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 on NK cells and the frequencies of Siglec-7+CD56dim NK cells were reduced in NAFLD patients. Notably, Siglec-7 levels on CD56dim NK cells were inversely correlated with PD-1, CD57, and ILT2 levels and positively correlated with NKp30 and NKp46 levels. Further subtyping of NK cells identified a highly dysfunctional Siglec-7-CD57+PD-1+CD56dim NK cell subset that was increased in patients with NAFLD, even those with mild liver fibrosis. Intrahepatic NK cells from NAFLD patients expressed elevated levels of NKG2D and CD69, suggesting a more activated phenotype than normal liver NK cells. These data identify a close association between NK cell function and expression of Siglec-7, CD57, and PD-1 that could potentially be therapeutically targeted in NAFLD."

One of its most notable applications is efficient multiplexing of samples into batches by dedicating a number of metal isotope channels to barcodes, enabling robust data acquisition and analysis. Barcoding is most effective when markers are present in all cells of interest. While CD45 has been shown to be a reliable marker for barcoding all immune cells in a given sample, a strategy to reliably barcode mouse cancer cells has not been demonstrated. To this end, we identified CD29 and CD98 as markers widely expressed by commonly used mouse cancer cell lines. We conjugated anti-CD29 and anti-CD98 antibodies to cadmium or indium metals and validated their utility in 10-plex barcoding of live cells. Finally, we established a potentially novel barcoding system incorporating the combination of CD29, CD98, and CD45 to multiplex 10 tumors from s.c. MC38 and KPC tumor models, while successfully recapitulating the known contrast in the PD1-PDL1 axis between the 2 models. The ability to barcode tumor cells along with immune cells empowers the interrogation of the tumor-immune interactions in mouse TME studies."

Using mass cytometry of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we identified effector memory CD4+ T cells and CD4-CD8low/-CD161+ T cells, specifically those positive for the chemokine receptor CCR6, as the circulating immune subtypes with the greatest response to IL-1β. This response manifested as increased phosphorylation and, thus, activation of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-κB and was also seen in other subsets, including CD11c+ myeloid dendritic cells, classical monocytes, two subsets of natural killer cells (CD16-CD56brightCD161- and CD16-CD56dimCD161+), and lineage- (Lin-) cells expressing CD161 and CD25. IL-1β also induced a rapid but less robust increase in the phosphorylation of the kinase p38 as compared to that of NF-κB in most of these immune cell subsets. Prolonged IL-1β stimulation increased the phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT3 and to a lesser extent that of STAT1 and STAT5 across various immune cell types. IL-1β-induced production of IL-6 likely led to the activation of STAT1 and STAT3 at later time points. Interindividual heterogeneity and inhibition of STAT activation by anakinra raise the possibility that assays measuring NF-κB phosphorylation in response to IL-1β in CCR6+ T cell subtypes could identify those patients at higher risk of cytokine storm and most likely to benefit from IL-1β-neutralizing therapies."

Compared to flow or mass cytometry, scRNA-Seq could potentially identify cell types and activation states that lack precise cell surface markers. However, scRNA-Seq is currently limited due to the need to manually classify each immune cell from its transcriptional profile. While recently developed algorithms accurately annotate coarse cell types (e.g. T cells versus macrophages), making fine distinctions (e.g. CD8+ effector memory T cells) remains a difficult challenge. To address this, we developed a machine learning classifier called ImmClassifier that leverages a hierarchical ontology of cell type. We demonstrate that its predictions are highly concordant with flow-based markers from CITE-seq and outperforms other tools (+15% recall, +14% precision) in distinguishing fine-grained cell types with comparable performance on coarse ones. Thus, ImmClassifier can be used to explore more deeply the heterogeneity of the immune system in scRNA-Seq experiments."

Epub 2021 Mar 4.,Keywords: CD16; CXCL7; FGL2; Gliomagenesis; Macrophages.,"Glioma stem cells (GSCs) are thought to underlie glioma initiation, evolution, resistance to therapies, and relapse. They are defined by their capacity to initiate glioma in immunocompromised mice which precludes analysis of their interaction with immune cells. Macrophages dominate the immune cell composition in glioma. We hypothesized that stemness and immune evasion induced by macrophages are closed intertwined in glioma. By using mass cytometry and RNA sequencing, we reveal that in immunocompetent mice, FGL2 promotes the stem-like phenotypes of glioma cells in an expression level-dependent manner. Mechanistically, FGL2-producing glioma cells recruit macrophages into the tumor microenvironment and induce the macrophages to secrete CXCL7 via the CD16/SyK/PI3K/HIF1α pathways. CXCL7, in turn, enhances the stem-like functionality of glioma cells, resulting in an increase in tumor incidence and progression that can be blocked with a neutralizing anti-CXCL7 antibody. Clinically, the FGL2-CXCL7 paracrine loop positively correlated with a higher macrophage signature and poorer prognosis in glioma patients. Thus, glioma cells' stem-like functionality is regulated by FGL2 in the presence of macrophages, and the FGL2-CXCL7 paracrine signaling axis is critical for regulating this function."

To contribute to revealing the cell types that may originate this tumor, we exploited mass cytometry, a single-cell technique that, by using heavy-metal-tagged antibodies, allows the accurate monitoring of the changes occurring in the mononuclear cell composition of skeletal muscle tissue during tumor development. To this end, we compared cell populations of healthy muscles with those from spatiotemporal-induced eRMS tumors in a mouse model (LSL-KrasG12D/+;Tp53Fl/Fl) that can be used to develop rhabdomyosarcoma by means of infection with an adenovirus vector expressing Cre (Ad-Cre) recombinase. By monitoring different time points after tumor induction, we were able to analyze tumor progression and composition, identifying fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) as the cell type that, in this model system, had a pivotal role in tumor development. In vitro studies highlighted that both FAPs and satellite cells (SCs), upon infection with the Ad-Cre, acquired the potential to develop rhabdomyosarcomas when transplanted into immunocompromised mice. However, only infected FAPs had an antigen profile that was similar to embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Overall, our analysis supports the involvement of FAPs in eRMS development."

Herein, we investigate the distribution of CD38 expression by peripheral blood leukocyte lineages to evaluate the potential therapeutic effect of CD38-targeting antibodies on these immune cell subsets and to delineate the use of CD38 as a biomarker in SLE. We analyzed the expression of CD38 on peripheral blood leukocyte subsets by flow and mass cytometry in two different cohorts, comprising a total of 56 SLE patients. The CD38 expression levels were subsequently correlated across immune cell lineages and subsets, and with clinical and serologic disease parameters of SLE. Compared to healthy controls (HC), CD38 expression levels in SLE were significantly increased on circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells, CD14++CD16+ monocytes, CD56+ CD16dim natural killer cells, marginal zone-like IgD+CD27+ B cells, and on CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells. Correlation analyses revealed coordinated CD38 expression between individual innate and memory T cell subsets in SLE but not HC. However, CD38 expression levels were heterogeneous across patients, and no correlation was found between CD38 expression on immune cell subsets and the disease activity index SLEDAI-2K or established serologic and immunological markers of disease activity. In conclusion, we identified widespread changes in CD38 expression on SLE immune cells that highly correlated over different leukocyte subsets within individual patients, but was heterogenous within the population of SLE patients, regardless of disease severity or clinical manifestations. As anti-CD38 treatment is being investigated in SLE, our results may have important implications for the personalized targeting of pathogenic leukocytes by anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies."

Reliable disease-related biomarkers are scarce, but single-cell mapping of the TME could identify patient-specific prognostic differences. To avoid technical variation effects, however, tissue dissociation effects on single cells must be considered. We present a novel Cytometry by Time-of-Flight antibody panel for single-cell suspensions to identify individual TME profiles of HGSOC patients and evaluate the effects of dissociation methods on results. The panel was developed utilizing cell lines, healthy donor blood, and stem cells and was applied to HGSOC tissues dissociated by six methods. Data were analyzed using Cytobank and X-shift and illustrated by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding plots, heatmaps, and stacked bar and error plots. The panel distinguishes the main cellular subsets and subpopulations, enabling characterization of individual TME profiles. The dissociation method affected some immune (n = 1), stromal (n = 2), and tumor (n = 3) subsets, while functional marker expressions remained comparable. In conclusion, the panel can identify subsets of the HGSOC TME and can be used for in-depth profiling. This panel represents a promising profiling tool for HGSOC when tissue handling is considered."

This will pave the way for utilizing appropriate clinically relevant mouse GBM models for evaluating novel immune-therapies in pre-clinical settings. Recent brain tumor immune-profiling studies using state-of-the-art time of flight cytometry (CyTOF) analysis compared different human and mouse GBM types and reported immunological distinctions amongst these mouse models. These studies also contrast the immune phenotype of brain tumor patients with commonly used pre-clinical immune-competent mouse models.

Here, we employed a two-pronged approach using single-cell mass cytometry and tissue imaging technologies to dissect TILs from 25 patients with resectable and 35 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We identified a burned-out CD8+ TIL subset (Ebo) that specifically accumulated within the tumor microenvironment (TME) but not in adjacent nontumoral tissues. Ebo showed the highest expression of proliferation and activation markers but produced the lowest amount of IFNγ and were the most apoptotic CD8+ TIL subset. Using a humanized patient-derived tumor xenograft model, we demonstrated that Ebo expansion occurred within the TME in a PD-1/B7-H1 pathway-dependent manner. Ebo abundance in baseline tumor tissues was associated with resistance to anti-PD therapy in patients with NSCLC. Our study identifies a dysfunctional TIL subset, with distinct features from previously described exhausted T cells, and implies strategies to overcome immunotherapy resistance. SIGNIFICANCE: We identified a highly proliferative, overactivated, and apoptotic dysfunctional CD8+ tumor-infiltrating subpopulation that is functionally distinct from previously described exhausted T cells. This population is expanded in lung cancer tissues in a PD-1/B7-H1-dependent manner, and its abundance is associated with resistance to cancer immunotherapy, thus becoming a potential tissue biomarker.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1601."

Single-cell mass cytometry is used to characterize the alloimmune response in early acute rejection, measuring 37 parameters simultaneously, across multiple time points in two models: a murine cardiac and vascularized composite allotransplant (VCA). Semi-supervised hierarchical clustering is used to group related cell types defined by combinatorial expression of surface and intracellular proteins, along with markers of effector function and activation. This expression profile is mapped to visualize changes in antigen composition across cell types, revealing phenotypic signatures in alloimmune T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and myeloid subsets that are conserved and that firmly distinguish rejecting from non-rejecting grafts. These data provide a comprehensive, high-dimensional profile of cellular rejection after allograft transplantation."

We performed mass cytometry, cytokine analysis, and RNA sequencing on bone marrow samples from 39 (13 newly diagnosed [NDMM], 11 relapsed pre-daratumumab exposure [RMM], and 13 triple-refractory [TRMM]) MM patients. Three distinct cellular iTME clusters were identified; cluster 1 comprised mainly of NDMM and RMM patients; and clusters 2 and 3 comprised primarily of TRMM patients. We showed that naive T cells were decreased in clusters 2 and 3, cluster 2 was characterized by increased senescent T cells, and cluster 3 by decreased early memory T cells. Plasma cells in clusters 2 and 3 upregulated E2F transcription factors and MYC proliferation pathways, and downregulated interferon, TGF-beta, interleuking-6, and TNF-αlpha signaling pathways compared to cluster 1. This study suggests that the MM iTME becomes increasingly dysfunctional with therapy whereas the MM clone may be less dependent on inflammation-mediated growth pathways and less sensitive to IFN-mediated immunosurveillance. Our findings may explain the decreased sensitivity of TRMM patients to novel immunotherapies."

However, the role of senescent CAFs in metastatic lesions and the molecular mechanism of inflammation-related SASP induction are not well understood. We show that pro-inflammatory cytokine-driven EZH2 downregulation maintains the SASP by demethylating H3K27me3 marks in CAFs and enhances peritoneal tumor formation of gastric cancer (GC) through JAK/STAT3 signaling in a mouse model. A JAK/STAT3 inhibitor blocks the increase in GC cell viability induced by senescent CAFs and peritoneal tumor formation. Single-cell mass cytometry revealed that fibroblasts exist in the ascites of GC patients with peritoneal dissemination, and the fibroblast population shows p16 expression and SASP factors at high levels. These findings provide insights into the inflammation-related SASP maintenance by histone modification and the role of senescent CAFs in GC peritoneal dissemination."

Dysregulation of the immune system underlies the pathogenesis of COVID-19, with inflammation mediated local tissue injury to the lung in the setting of suppressed systemic immune function. To define the molecular mechanisms of immune dysfunction in COVID-19 we utilized a systems immunology approach centered on the circulating leukocyte phosphoproteome measured by mass cytometry. COVID-19 is associated with wholesale activation of a broad set of signaling pathways across myeloid and lymphoid cell populations. STAT3 phosphorylation predominated in both monocytes and T cells and was tightly correlated with circulating IL-6 levels. High levels of STAT3 phosphorylation was associated with decreased markers of myeloid cell maturation/activation and decreased ex-vivo T cell IFN-gamma production, demonstrating that during COVID-19 dysregulated cellular activation is associated with suppression of immune effector cell function. Collectively, these data reconcile the systemic inflammatory response and functional immunosuppression induced by COVID-19 and suggest STAT3 signaling may be the central pathophysiologic mechanism driving immune dysfunction in COVID-19."

In this project, we identify immune pattern of clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC) by estimating the percentage of each immune cell type in 526 renal tumors using the new powerful technique of digital cytometry. The results, which are in agreement with the results of a large-scale mass cytometry analysis, show that the most frequent immune cell types in ccRCC tumors are CD8+ T-cells, macrophages, and CD4+ T-cells. Saliently, unsupervised clustering of ccRCC primary tumors based on their relative number of immune cells indicates the existence of four distinct groups of ccRCC tumors. Tumors in the first group consist of approximately the same numbers of macrophages and CD8+ T-cells and and a slightly smaller number of CD4+ T cells than CD8+ T cells, while tumors in the second group have a significantly high number of macrophages compared to any other immune cell type (P-value [Formula: see text]). The third group of ccRCC tumors have a significantly higher number of CD8+ T-cells than any other immune cell type (P-value [Formula: see text]), while tumors in the group 4 have approximately the same numbers of macrophages and CD4+ T-cells and a significantly smaller number of CD8+ T-cells than CD4+ T-cells (P-value [Formula: see text]). Moreover, there is a high positive correlation between the expression levels of IFNG and PDCD1 and the percentage of CD8+ T-cells, and higher stage and grade of tumors have a substantially higher percentage of CD8+ T-cells.

In vivo HMA treatment promotes CD8+ T cell tumor infiltration and suppresses tumor growth via CD8+ T cell-dependent activity. Ex vivo, HMAs enhance primary human CD8+ T cell activation markers, effector cytokine production, and anti-tumor cytolytic activity. Epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling shows that HMAs vastly regulate T cell activation-related transcriptional networks, culminating with over-activation of NFATc1 short isoforms. Mechanistically, demethylation of an intragenic CpG island immediately downstream to the 3' UTR of the short isoform was associated with antisense transcription and alternative polyadenylation of NFATc1 short isoforms. High-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry analyses reveal a selective effect of HMAs on a subset of human CD8+ T cell subpopulations, increasing both the number and abundance of a granzyme Bhigh, perforinhigh effector subpopulation. Overall, our findings support the use of HMAs as a therapeutic strategy to boost anti-tumor immune response."

However, it is still poorly described at the single cell level, and tissue samples are not easily accessible. Thus, a detailed analysis of the circulating myeloid cell compartment in the different B lymphomas is needed to better understand the mechanisms of resistance to treatment and identify at risk patients. In this Perspective, we review current knowledge on the phenotypic and functional description of the circulating monocytic lineage in B cell lymphomas and provide first insights into the heterogeneity of these cell populations in health and lymphoma, using mass cytometry. Indeed, the monocytic compartment is a continuum more than distinct subpopulations, as demonstrated by our high-resolution approach, explaining the sometimes confusing and contradictory conclusions on the prognostic impact of the different populations, including monocytes and monocytic myeloid derived suppressor cells (M-MDSC).

Blood samples from healthy donors were stored at room temperature (RT) or refrigerated at 4°C before preparation of PBMCs. Cell yield and viability, and proportions of major cell populations within PBMCs, as determined by fluorescence flow cytometry, were assessed for both fresh and cryopreserved samples. Highly multiparametric mass cytometry was performed on cryopreserved PBMCs. We found that refrigeration had marked negative effects on subsequent PBMC yield. Storage at RT led to co-purification of low density neutrophils with PBMCs, but had no detectable effects on the proportions of multiple cell subsets including, but not limited to, monocytes, NK cells, B cells, Treg cells, and naïve, central memory and effector memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and CD45RA-positive terminal effector CD8+ T cells. Expression of a number of cell surface receptors, including CXCR5, CCR6, CXCR3 and TIGIT, but not CD247 was reduced after RT storage before PBMC preparation, and this effect correlated with the degree of low density neutrophil contamination. As such, when PBMC preparation cannot be undertaken immediately after blood draw, storage at RT is far superior to refrigeration. RT storage leads to neutrophil activation, but does not compromise measurement of PBMC subset distribution. However caution must be applied to interpretation of cytometric measurements of surface molecules such as chemokine receptors."

Using gene expression (RNA-seq), epigenomic (ATAC-seq) and immunophenotyping (CyToF) analysis, we associate each subtype with specific molecular characteristics, disease differentiation state and patient survival. Using ex vivo drug sensitivity profiling, we show a differential drug response of the subtypes to specific kinase inhibitors, irrespective of the FLT3-ITD status. Differential drug responses of the primitive and committed subtype are validated in an independent AML cohort.

Clinical phase 1 and 2 studies have demonstrated TSO treatment to be safe and well tolerated in MS patients, however, they reported only modest clinical efficacy. We therefore addressed the cellular and humoral immune responses directed against parasite antigens in individual MS patients receiving controlled TSO treatment (2500 TSO p.o. every 2 weeks for 12 month). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of MS patients treated with TSO (n = 5) or placebo (n = 6) were analyzed. A continuous increase of serum IgG and IgE antibodies specific for T. suis excretory/secretory antigens was observed up to 12 months post-treatment. This was consistent with mass cytometry analysis identifying an increase of activated HLA-DRhigh plasmablast frequencies in TSO-treated patients. While stable and comparable frequencies of total CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were detected in placebo and TSO-treated patients over time, we observed an increase of activated HLA-DR+CD4+ T cells in TSO-treated patients only. Frequencies of Gata3+ Th2 cells and Th1/Th2 ratios remained stable during TSO treatment, while Foxp3+ Treg frequencies varied greatly between individuals. Using a T. suis antigen-specific T cell expansion assay, we also detected patient-to-patient variation of antigen-specific T cell recall responses and cytokine production. In summary, MS patients receiving TSO treatment established a T. suis-specific T- and B-cell response, however, with varying degrees of T cell responses and cellular functionality across individuals, which might account for the overall miscellaneous clinical efficacy in the studied patients."

Analytical treatment interruption (ATI) was performed between W36 to W48. At W28, vaccinees experienced an increase in functional CD4+ T-cell responses (P < 0.001 for each cytokine compared to W0) measured, predominantly against Gag and Pol/Env, and an increase in HIV-specific CD8+ T cells producing interleukin 2 (IL-2) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) (P = 0.001 and 0.013, respectively), predominantly against Pol/Env and Nef. However, analysis of T-cell subsets by mass cytometry in a subpopulation showed an increase in the W28/W0 ratio for memory CD8+ T cells coexpressing exhaustion and senescence markers such as PD-1/TIGIT (P = 0.004) and CD27/CD57 (P = 0.044) in vaccinees compared to the placebo group. During ATI, all patients experienced viral rebound, with the maximum observed HIV RNA level at W42 (median, 4.63 log10 copies [cp]/ml; interquartile range [IQR], 4.00 to 5.09), without any difference between arms. No patient resumed cART for CD4 cell count drop. Globally, the vaccine strategy was safe. However, a secondary HIV transmission during ATI was observed. These data show that the prime-boost combination of DNA and LIPO-5 vaccines elicited broad and polyfunctional T cells. The contrast between the quality of immune responses and the lack of potent viral control underscores the need for combined immunomodulatory strategies.

We show here that this prime-boost strategy is well tolerated, consistently with previous studies in HIV-1-infected individuals and healthy volunteers who received each vaccine component individually. Compared to the placebo group, vaccinees elicited strong and polyfunctional HIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. However, these immune responses presented some qualitative defects and were not able to control viremia following antiretroviral treatment interruption, as no difference in HIV viral rebound was observed in the vaccine and placebo groups. Several lessons were learned from these results, pointing out the urgent need to combine vaccine strategies with other immune-based interventions."

Dendritic cells (DC) are key players of the immune system by serving as regulators of immune responses. Their function has been scarcely studied in MDS and most of the reported studies didn't investigate naturally occurring DC subsets. Therefore, we here examined the frequency and function of DC subsets and slan+ non-classical monocytes in various MDS risk groups. Frequencies of DC as well as of slan+ monocytes were decreased in MDS bone marrow compared to normal bone marrow samples. Transcriptional profiling revealed down-regulation of transcripts related to pro-inflammatory pathways in MDS-derived cells as compared to normal bone marrow. Additionally, their capacity to induce T-cell proliferation was impaired. Multidimensional mass cytometry showed that whereas healthy donor-derived slan+ monocytes supported Th1/Th17/Treg differentiation/expansion their MDS-derived counterparts also mediated substantial Th2 expansion. Our findings point to a role for an impaired ability of DC subsets to adequately respond to cellular stress and DNA damage in the immune escape and progression of MDS. As such, it paves the way toward potential novel immunotherapeutic interventions."

Over the last few years, state-of-the-art technologies, including whole-exome sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing, and mass cytometry, have precisely dissected the specific cellular phenotypes present in the FL microenvironment network and their role in the disease. In this already complex picture, the presence of recurring mutations, including KMT2D, CREBBP, EZH2, and TNFRSF14, have a prominent contributory role, with some of them finely tuning this exquisite dependence of FL on its microenvironment. This precise characterization of the enemy (FL) and its allies (microenvironment) has paved the way for the development of novel therapies aimed at dismantling this contact network, weakening tumor cell support, and reactivating the host's immune response against the tumor.

The metabolic phenotypes and dependencies of these cells, however, remain poorly understood in the regulation of airway inflammation. In this study, we show the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of asthmatic patients had markers of elevated glucose and glutamine metabolism. Further, peripheral blood T cells of asthmatics had broadly elevated expression of metabolic proteins when analyzed by mass cytometry compared with healthy controls. Therefore, we hypothesized that glucose and glutamine metabolism promote allergic airway inflammation. We tested this hypothesis in two murine models of airway inflammation. T cells from lungs of mice sensitized with Alternaria alternata extract displayed genetic signatures for elevated oxidative and glucose metabolism by single-cell RNA sequencing. This result was most pronounced when protein levels were measured in IL-17-producing cells and was recapitulated when airway inflammation was induced with house dust mite plus LPS, a model that led to abundant IL-4- and IL-17-producing T cells. Importantly, inhibitors of the glucose transporter 1 or glutaminase in vivo attenuated house dust mite + LPS eosinophilia, T cell cytokine production, and airway hyperresponsiveness as well as augmented the immunosuppressive properties of dexamethasone. These data show that T cells induce markers to support metabolism in vivo in airway inflammation and that this correlates with inflammatory cytokine production. Targeting metabolic pathways may provide a new direction to protect from disease and enhance the effectiveness of steroid therapy."

Various Treg subsets have been identified, however the heterogeneity of Treg subpopulations during development remains uncharacterized. Using mass cytometry we obtained single cell data on expression of 35 functional markers to examine the heterogeneity of Treg cells at birth and in adults. Unsupervised clustering algorithms FlowSOM and ACCENSE were used to quantify Treg heterogeneity. As expected, Treg in umbilical cord blood were predominately naïve while Treg in adult blood were predominately central memory and effector memory cells. Although umbilical cord blood Treg are mostly naïve cells, we observed multiple phenotypic Treg subsets in cord blood. Nevertheless, peripheral blood in adults contained higher percentages of Treg and the heterogeneity of Treg was significantly increased in adults. We also studied Treg heterogeneity throughout a 2-year period after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) and in patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD). Treg heterogeneity recovered rapidly after alloHSCT and gradually increased in the first two years post-transplant. However, patients with cGVHD had significantly fewer distinct Treg subpopulations, proposing a correlation between a disrupted Treg heterogeneity and cGVHD. Our study is the first to compare human Treg heterogeneity at birth, in healthy adults and in patients after alloHSCT with and without cGVHD. This approach to characterize Treg heterogeneity based on expression of a large panel of functional markers may enable future studies to identify specific Treg defects that contribute to immune dysfunction."

Our knowledge is weakest for NaLnF4 NPs with the lowest atomic mass lanthanides (Yan's group 1: La to Nd) and more advanced for group 2 (Sm to Tb) NaLnF4 NPs [Mai et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2006, 128, 6426]. Here we focus on the synthesis of NaNdF4 NPs. We employed the high-temperature chemical coprecipitation method and explored the influence of a wide range of synthesis parameters (e.g., reaction time and temperature, precursor ratios (Na+/Nd3+ and F-/Nd3+), choice of a sodium precursor (Na-oleate or NaOH), and the amount of oleic acid) on the size and uniformity of the NPs obtained. We tried to identify ""sweet spots"" in the reaction space that led to uniform NaNdF4 NPs with sizes appropriate for mass tag applications in mass cytometry. We were able to obtain NPs with a variety of sizes in the range of 5-38 nm with several different shapes (e.g., polyhedra, spheres, and rods). XRD patterns recorded for aliquots collected at different reaction time intervals revealed that NaNdF4 nucleated in the cubic phase (α) and then transformed to the hexagonal phase (β) as the reaction progressed up to 2 h. A very striking observation was that the NPs synthesized using NaOH as a reactant preferred to remain in the α-phase, and for a lower reaction temperature (285 °C), did not undergo a phase transformation to the β-phase over 2 h of reaction time. Under similar experimental conditions, NPs prepared using Na-oleate exhibited an α → β phase transformation. Nevertheless, NaNdF4 NPs prepared at a higher temperature (315 °C) using either of the Na+ precursors exhibited the α → β phase transformation over time. This transition, however, appeared to be faster in the case of the NPs synthesized using Na-oleate. We found that, in many instances, syntheses carried out using Na-oleate produced more uniform NPs compared to those synthesized using NaOH. Under the conditions we employed for the Na-oleate precursor, the NPs initially formed were polydisperse spheres that evolved into irregular polyhedra and eventually formed more uniform rod-shaped NPs. The aspect ratio of the final NPs depended on the Na+/Nd3+ precursor ratio. High-resolution transmission electron micrographs and corresponding fast Fourier transform of the data provided information about the preferred growth direction of the NaNdF4 nanorods."

Hospitalized patients negative for SARS-CoV-2 were used as controls.RESULTSWe found that the immune landscape in COVID-19 formed 3 dominant clusters, which correlated with disease severity. Longitudinal analysis identified a pattern of productive innate and adaptive immune responses in individuals who had a moderate disease course, whereas those with severe disease had features suggestive of a protracted and dysregulated immune response. Further, we identified coordinate immune alterations accompanying clinical improvement and decline that were also seen in patients who received IL-6 pathway blockade.CONCLUSIONThe hospitalized COVID-19 negative cohort allowed us to identify immune alterations that were shared between severe COVID-19 and other critically ill patients. Collectively, our findings indicate that selection of immune interventions should be based in part on disease presentation and early disease trajectory due to the profound differences in the immune response in those with mild to moderate disease and those with the most severe disease.FUNDINGBenaroya Family Foundation, the Leonard and Norma Klorfine Foundation, Glenn and Mary Lynn Mounger, and the National Institutes of Health."

Here, we examined how chronic viral infections alter the pulmonary microenvironment to foster coinfection and worsen disease severity. We developed a coordinated system of chronic virus and Mtb infection that induced central clinical manifestations of coinfection, including increased Mtb burden, extra-pulmonary dissemination, and heightened mortality. These disease states were not due to chronic virus-induced immunosuppression or exhaustion; rather, increased amounts of the cytokine TNFα initially arrested pulmonary Mtb growth, impeding dendritic cell mediated antigen transportation to the lymph node and subverting immune-surveillance, allowing bacterial sanctuary. The cryptic Mtb replication delayed CD4 T cell priming, redirecting T helper (Th) 1 toward Th17 differentiation and increasing pulmonary neutrophilia, which diminished long-term survival. Temporally restoring CD4 T cell induction overcame these diverse disease sequelae to enhance Mtb control. Thus, Mtb co-opts TNFα from the chronic inflammatory environment to subvert immune-surveillance, avert early immune function, and foster long-term coinfection."

Nonetheless, insights regarding Vδ2+ γδ T cell phenotypic alterations in human breast cancers are still lacking. This paucity of information is partly due to the challenging scarcity of these cells in surgical specimens. αβ T cell phenotypic alterations occurring in the tumor bed are detectable in the periphery and correlate with adverse clinical outcomes. Thus, we sought to determine through an exploratory study whether Vδ2+ γδ T cells phenotypic changes can be detected within breast cancer patients' peripheral blood, along with association with tumor progression. By using mass cytometry, we quantified 130 immune variables from untreated breast cancer patients' peripheral blood. Supervised analyses and dimensionality reduction algorithms evidenced circulating Vδ2+ γδ T cell phenotypic alterations already established at diagnosis. Foremost, terminally differentiated Vδ2+ γδ T cells displaying phenotypes of exhausted senescent T cells associated with lymph node involvement.

This study investigated the types of recruited mononuclear phagocytes and the immunotherapeutic effects of allograft mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were orotracheally instilled with LPS (20 mg/kg). Compact bone-derived MSCs were administered orotracheally 4 h after LPS inhalation. Mononuclear phagocytes recruited in the lung tissues were characterized at different timepoints by high-dimensional analysis including flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and single-cell RNA sequencing. Results: Eight mononuclear phagocyte subsets recruited to LPS-challenged lungs were precisely identified. On day 3 after LPS administration, both Ly6ChiCD38+ and Ly6ClowCD38+ monocytes were recruited into acutely injured lungs, which was associated with increased secretion of neutrophil chemokines. Ly6ChiCD38+ monocytes differentiated into M1 macrophages on day 3, and subsequently differentiated into CD38+ monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mo-DCs) on day 7, while Ly6ClowCD38+ monocytes differentiated into CD11b+CD38+ DCs on day 7. When ALI mice were treated with MSCs, the mortality significantly reduced. Notably, MSCs reduced the amount of M1 macrophages and reduced the secretion of neutrophil chemokines on day 3. Furthermore, MSCs reduced the number of CD38+ mo-DCs and CD11b+CD38+ DCs on day 7, suppressing the antigen presentation process. Recruited mononuclear phagocyte subsets with a high level of CD38 exhibited an activated phenotype and could secrete higher levels of cytokines and chemokines. Conclusions: This study characterized the dynamic functions and phenotypes of recruited mononuclear phagocytes in ALI mice and MSC-treated ALI mice."

To examine immune reconstitution in these patients, we monitored T- and natural killer (NK)-cell recovery in 60 patients receiving bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts after haplo-HCT with PTCy and 35 patients receiving HLA-matched donor PBSC grafts with standard graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Compared with HLA-matched recipients, early T-cell recovery was delayed in haplo-HCT patients and skewed toward effector memory T cells with markedly reduced naive T cells. We found higher regulatory T (Treg)-cell/conventional T (Tcon)-cell ratios early after HCT and increased PD-1 expression on memory T cells. Within the haplo-HCT, patients who did not develop chronic GVHD (cGVHD) had higher PD-1 expression on central and effector memory CD4+ Treg cells at 1 month after transplant. These findings suggest an immunologic milieu that promotes immune tolerance in haplo-HCT patients. NK cells were decreased early after haplo-HCT with preferential expansion of immature CD56brightCD16- NK cells compared with matched donor transplants. One month after transplant, mass cytometry revealed enrichment of immature NK-cell metaclusters with high NKG2A, low CD57, and low killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor expression after haplo-HCT, which partially recovered 3 months post-HCT. At 2 months, immature NK cells from both groups were functionally impaired, but interleukin-15 priming corrected these defects in vitro. Increased immature/mature NK-cell ratios were associated with cytomegalovirus reactivation and increased incidence of cGVHD after haplo-HCT. These homeostatic imbalances in T- and NK-cell reconstitution after haplo-HCT reveal opportunities for early immune-based interventions to optimize clinical outcomes."

However, wide deployment of CyTOF-based immune phenotyping studies are limited by complex experimental workflows and the need for specialized CyTOF equipment and technical expertise. Furthermore, differences in cell isolation and enrichment protocols, antibody reagent preparation, sample staining, and data acquisition protocols can all introduce technical variation that can confound integrative analyses of large data-sets of samples processed across multiple labs. Here, we present a streamlined whole blood CyTOF workflow which addresses many of these sources of experimental variation and facilitates wider adoption of CyTOF immune monitoring across sites with limited technical expertise or sample-processing resources or equipment. Our workflow utilizes commercially available reagents including the Fluidigm MaxPar Direct Immune Profiling Assay (MDIPA), a dry tube 30-marker immunophenotyping panel, and SmartTube Proteomic Stabilizer, which allows for simple and reliable fixation and cryopreservation of whole blood samples. We validate a workflow that allows for streamlined staining of whole blood samples with minimal processing requirements or expertise at the site of sample collection, followed by shipment to a central CyTOF core facility for batched downstream processing and data acquisition. We apply this workflow to characterize 184 whole blood samples collected longitudinally from a cohort of 72 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, highlighting dynamic disease-associated changes in circulating immune cell frequency and phenotype."

In B cells, TLR ligation is important for their activation and, together with CD40, for their differentiation. TLR ligands are also strong promoters of regulatory B (Breg)-cell development, by enhancing the production of IL-10 and their capacity to induce tolerance. In inflammatory diseases, such as autoimmunity or allergies, Breg-cell function is often impaired, while in chronic infections, such as with helminths, or cancer, Breg-cell function is boosted. Following pathogen exposure, B cells can respond directly by producing cytokines and/or IgM (innate response) and develop into various memory B (Bmem)-cell subsets with class-switched immunoglobulin receptors. Depending on the disease state or chronic infection conditions, various Breg subsets can be recognized as well. Currently, a large array of surface markers is known to distinguish between these large range of B-cell subsets. In recent years, the development of mass cytometers and spectral flow cytometry has allowed for high-dimensional detection of up to 48 markers, including both surface and intracellular/intranuclear markers. Therefore, this novel technology is highly suitable to provide a comprehensive overview of Bmem/Breg-cell subsets in different disease states and/or in clinical intervention trials. Here, we provide detailed instructions of the steps necessary to obtain high-quality data for high-dimensional analysis of multiple human Breg-cell subsets using various TLR ligands."

We reported previously that VCAM-1 mediates monocyte adhesion to LSECs. However, the pathogenic role of VCAM-1 in NASH is unclear. Herein, we report that VCAM-1 was a top upregulated adhesion molecule in the NASH mouse liver transcriptome. Open chromatin landscape profiling combined with genome-wide transcriptome analysis showed robust transcriptional upregulation of LSEC VCAM-1 in murine NASH. Moreover, LSEC VCAM-1 expression was significantly increased in human NASH. LSEC VCAM-1 expression was upregulated by palmitate treatment in vitro and reduced with inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein 3 kinase (MAP3K) mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3). Likewise, LSEC VCAM-1 expression was reduced in the Mlk3-/- mice with diet-induced NASH. Furthermore, VCAM-1 neutralizing Ab or pharmacological inhibition attenuated diet-induced NASH in mice, mainly via reducing the proinflammatory monocyte hepatic population as examined by mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF). Moreover, endothelium-specific Vcam1 knockout mice were also protected against NASH. In summary, lipotoxic stress enhances the expression of LSEC VCAM-1, in part, through MLK3 signaling. Inhibition of VCAM-1 was salutary in murine NASH and might serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for human NASH."

Cisplatin is commonly used as a viability stain in mass cytometry studies, however, recent work by Mei et al. has demonstrated that cisplatin can also be used to label antibodies, complicating the simultaneous use of the platinum measurement channels for both antibody and viability staining. This study demonstrates that other metal salts (hafnium chloride, niobium chloride, and zirconium chloride) can serve as substitutes for cisplatin in viability staining. These stains yield similar fractions of live and dead cells and stain the same dead cells in parallel high parameter analyses. In addition, this study demonstrates how a variety of protein antigen viability markers (pRb, Ki-67, Histone H1, cleaved PARP, and GAPDH) can be used to discriminate live and dead cell populations, without the need for a separate viability staining step. As few as two of these protein antigen viability markers can help identify live and dead cell populations in fixed samples and can identify the same viable cells in high dimensional analyses with or without use of viability stain information. This study demonstrates several alternative approaches to mass cytometry viability assessment that can facilitate use of platinum isotopes for antibody staining and enables identification of live and dead cell populations in samples for which a separate viability stain is not practical."

While we evaluate IFN-γ production during Burkholderia thailandensis infection, this protocol can be applied to other cytokines and other mouse models. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Kovacs et al. (2020) and Liu and Whitton (2005)."

A better understanding of the development of memory T cell heterogeneity is however required to enhance vaccination and immunotherapy approaches. Here we examined the impact of pathogen- and tissue-specific cues on memory CD8+ T cell heterogeneity using high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry and a tailored bioinformatics pipeline. We identified distinct populations of pathogen-specific CD8+ T cells that uniquely connected to a specific pathogen or associated to multiple types of acute and persistent infections. In addition, the tissue environment shaped the memory CD8+ T cell heterogeneity, albeit to a lesser extent than infection. The programming of memory CD8+ T cell differentiation during acute infection is eventually superseded by persistent infection. Thus, the plethora of distinct memory CD8+ T cell subsets that arise upon infection is dominantly sculpted by the pathogen-specific cues and further shaped by the tissue environment."

Here we describe the development and validation of a 33-marker mass cytometry workflow for measuring gastrointestinal (GI) trafficking peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in patients with celiac disease (CeD). This panel builds upon identification of well-characterized immune cells and expands to include markers modulated in response to gluten challenge in patients with CeD. The CeD panel was optimized and validated according to accepted industry practice for validation of flow cytometry assays and builds upon established sample processing workflows for mass cytometry studies. Several critical parameters were evaluated during the assay development phase of this study including optimization of the sample processing steps, antibody specificity, and ensuring the panel as a whole performed to expectation. The panel was then validated using a fit-for-purpose approach tailored to the intended use of the data in the clinical trial. Validation included assessment of analytical parameters essential to understanding the reliability and robustness of the CeD panel such as intra-assay precision, inter-assay precision, inter-operator precision and sample processing stability. Together, this validated mass cytometry workstream provides robust and reproducible high-dimensional analysis of human peripheral blood immune cells to characterize patient samples from clinical trials."

In this study, we investigated the leukocyte response to a Vi-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (Vi-TT) in comparison with a plain polysaccharide vaccine (Vi-PS) in healthy adults subsequently challenged with Salmonella Typhi. Immunological responses and their association with challenge outcome was assessed by mass cytometry and Vi-ELISpot assay. Immunization induced significant expansion of plasma cells in both vaccines with modest T follicular helper cell responses detectable after Vi-TT only. The Vi-specific IgG and IgM B cell response was considerably greater in magnitude in Vi-TT recipients. Intriguingly, a significant increase in a subset of IgA+ plasma cells expressing mucosal migratory markers α4β7 and CCR10 was observed in both vaccine groups, suggesting a gut-tropic, mucosal response is induced by Vi-vaccination. The total plasma cell response was significantly associated with protection against typhoid fever in Vi-TT vaccinees but not Vi-PS. IgA+ plasma cells were not significantly associated with protection for either vaccine, although a trend is seen for Vi-PS. Conversely, the IgA- fraction of the plasma cell response was only associated with protection in Vi-TT. In summary, these data indicate that a phenotypically heterogeneous response including both gut-homing and systemic antibody secreting cells may be critical for protection induced by Vi-TT vaccination."

However, very little is known about immune cell and cytokine alterations in specific organs of COVID-19 patients. Here, we evaluated immune cells and cytokines in postmortem tissues, i.e., lungs, intestine, liver, kidneys, and spleen of three patients with COVID-19. Imaging mass cytometry revealed monocyte, macrophage, and dendritic cell (DC) infiltration in the lung, intestine, kidney, and liver tissues. Moreover, in patients with COVID-19, natural killer T cells infiltrated the liver, lungs, and intestine, whereas B cells infiltrated the kidneys, lungs, and intestine. CD11b+ macrophages and CD11c+ DCs also infiltrated the lungs and intestine, a phenomenon that was accompanied by overproduction of the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin (IL)-10. However, CD11b+ macrophages and CD11c+ DCs in the lungs or intestine of COVID-19 patients did not express human leukocyte antigen DR isotype. In contrast, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α expression was higher in the lungs, intestine, liver, and kidneys, but not in the spleen, of all COVID-19 patients (compared to levels in controls). Collectively, these findings suggested that IL-10 and TNF-α as immunosuppressive and pro-inflammatory agents, respectively,-might be prognostic and could serve as therapeutic targets for COVID-19."

We investigated transmembrane proteins expression with a customized mass cytometry panel of 21 antibodies. Platelets of 8 hospitalized COVID-19 patients not requiring intensive care support and without pre-existing conditions were compared to platelets of healthy controls (11 donors) with and without in vitro stimulation with thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP). Mass cytometry of non-stimulated platelets detected an increased surface expression of activation markers P-Selectin (0.67 vs. 1.87 median signal intensity for controls vs. patients, p = 0.0015) and LAMP-3 (CD63, 0.37 vs. 0.81, p = 0.0004), the GPIIb/IIIa complex (4.58 vs. 5.03, p < 0.0001) and other adhesion molecules involved in platelet activation and platelet-leukocyte interactions. Upon TRAP stimulation, mass cytometry detected a higher expression of P-selectin in COVID-19 samples compared to controls (p < 0.0001). However, we observed a significantly reduced capacity of COVID-19 platelets to increase the expression of activation markers LAMP-3 and P-Selectin upon stimulation with TRAP. We detected a hyperactivated phenotype in platelets during SARS-CoV-2 infection, consisting of highly expressed platelet activation markers, which might contribute to the hypercoagulopathy observed in COVID-19. In addition, several transmembrane proteins were more highly expressed compared to healthy controls. These findings support research projects investigating antithrombotic and antiplatelet treatment regimes in COVID-19 patients, and provide new insights on the phenotypical platelet expression during SARS-CoV-2 infection."

A major therapeutic goal is to target GBM stem cells (GSCs), a subpopulation of cells that contribute to treatment resistance and recurrence. Since their discovery in 2003, GSCs have been isolated using single-surface markers, such as CD15, CD44, CD133, and α6 integrin. It remains unknown how these single-surface marker-defined GSC populations compare with each other in terms of signaling and function and whether expression of different combinations of these markers is associated with different functional capacity. Using mass cytometry and fresh operating room specimens, we found 15 distinct GSC subpopulations in patients, and they differed in their MEK/ERK, WNT, and AKT pathway activation status. Once in culture, some subpopulations were lost and previously undetectable ones materialized. GSCs that highly expressed all 4 surface markers had the greatest self-renewal capacity, WNT inhibitor sensitivity, and in vivo tumorigenicity. This work highlights the potential signaling and phenotypic diversity of GSCs. Larger patient sample sizes and antibody panels are required to confirm these findings."

Although platelets are often treated as a homogeneous cell population, they are known to be heterogeneous in size, age, surface receptor expression, and response to agonist stimulation, raising the possibility that distinct platelet subsets perform specialized functions and that such subsets may be altered in disease settings. Attempts to identify platelet subsets by flow cytometry have had limited success due in part to limits on the number of probes that can be used at the same time and due to the challenges of compensating for probes that have large spectral overlap. We recently reported a method to identify platelet subsets by mass cytometry using a panel of 14 metal-tagged antibodies directed at platelet surface markers. Here, we describe the technical considerations and best practices for platelet sample preparation, processing, and analysis by mass cytometry. Specifically, we show that anticoagulant choice alters platelet phenotype and function and that antibody cocktail storage and sample processing are critical for reproducibility. Additionally, we optimize sample density and instrument setup for maximal platelet transmission. Lastly, we demonstrate the importance of panel design and compensation and the use of clustering and dimension reduction to map platelet heterogeneity across resting and stimulated samples."

In this study, we profiled the transcriptomes of intrahepatic CD45+ immune cells, from mice, using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology to understand the landscape of intrahepatic immune cells during the pathogenesis of fibrosis. Analysis of approximately 10,000 single-cell transcriptomes revealed an increase in dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, and neutrophils and a decrease in T and natural killer T (NKT) cells. In addition, we report changes in the transcriptomes of diverse immune cell types, implying a deteriorating intrahepatic immune microcircumstance. Furthermore, we uncovered a novel fibrosis-associated CD8 T (Ccl5+, Ccl4+) and CD4 T (mt-Co1+) cell subpopulation, which infiltrates fibrotic liver and is characterized by abnormal activation or inactivation as well as a TCR decline. The results from scRNA-seq and bulk immune repertoire sequencing (IR-seq) revealed an obvious decline in T cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes combined with shrinking VJ and VDJ segment usage, as well as lower complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) amino acid (AA) diversity from fibrotic liver. Interestingly, a deficiency of TCR IR (TcrbKO mice) led to a deterioration of liver fibrosis, coupled with activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) induced by the upregulation of macrophage and γδ T cell distribution in fibrotic TcrbKO livers. Our findings reveal the landscape and dynamics of single immune cells in liver fibrosis, and clarify the protective role of TCR IR in response to chronic liver injury."

Epub 2020 Dec 22.,Article has no keywords,"Satellite cells provide regenerative capacity to the skeletal muscle after injury. In this process, termed myogenesis, satellite cells get activated, proliferate, and differentiate. Myogenesis is recapitulated in the tissue culture of myoblasts that differentiate by fusion and then by the formation of myotubes. Autophagy plays an important role in myogenesis, but the asynchronous and unique trajectory of differentiation of each myoblast along the myogenic lineage complicates teasing apart at what stages of differentiation autophagy plays a critical role. In this report, we describe a mass cytometric, multidimensional, individual cell analysis of differentiating myoblasts that characterizes autophagy flux (i.e., autophagy rate) at separate myogenesis stages. Because mass cytometry uses a set of lanthanide-tagged antibodies, each being specific for a desired molecular target, quantification of each molecular target could be exaggerated by nonspecific binding of its respective antibody to other nontarget cellular regions. In this report, we used lanthanide-tagged isotypes, which allowed for correction for nonspecific binding at the single-cell level. Using this approach, myoblasts were phenotypically identified by their position in the myogenic lineage, simultaneously with the quantification of autophagic flux in each identified subset. We found that generally autophagy flux is upregulated specifically during myoblast fusion and declines in myotubes. We also observed that mitophagy (i.e., selective autophagic degradation of mitochondria) is also active after myotube formation. The ability to track different types of autophagy is another feature of this methodology, which could be key to expand the current understanding of autophagy regulation in regenerating the skeletal muscle."

Epub 2020 Dec 31.,Keywords: CyTOF; compensation; mass cytometry; spillover; statistical methods.,"Signal intensity measured in a mass cytometry (CyTOF) channel can often be affected by the neighboring channels due to technological limitations. Such signal artifacts are known as spillover effects and can substantially limit the accuracy of cell population clustering. Current approaches reduce these effects by using additional beads for normalization purposes known as single-stained controls. While effective in compensating for spillover effects, incorporating single-stained controls can be costly and require customized panel design. This is especially evident when executing large-scale immune profiling studies. We present a novel statistical method, named CytoSpill that independently quantifies and compensates the spillover effects in CyTOF data without requiring the use of single-stained controls. Our method utilizes knowledge-guided modeling and statistical techniques, such as finite mixture modeling and sequential quadratic programming, to achieve optimal error correction. We evaluated our method using five publicly available CyTOF datasets obtained from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), C57BL/6J mouse bone marrow, healthy human bone marrow, chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient, and healthy human cord blood samples. In the PBMCs with known ground truth, our method achieved comparable results to experiments that incorporated single-stained controls. In datasets without ground-truth, our method not only reduced spillover on likely affected markers, but also led to the discovery of potentially novel subpopulations expressing functionally meaningful, cluster-specific markers. CytoSpill (developed in R) will greatly enhance the execution of large-scale cellular profiling of tumor immune microenvironment, development of novel immunotherapy, and the discovery of immune-specific biomarkers. The implementation of our method can be found at https://github.com/KChen-lab/CytoSpill.git."

The states of these pathways and their inputs determine signaling dynamics and drive cell function. Within a cancerous tumor, many combinations of cell states and microenvironments can lead to dramatic variations in responses to treatment. Network rewiring has been thought to underlie these context-dependent differences in signaling; however, from a biochemical standpoint, rewiring of signaling networks should not be a prerequisite for heterogeneity in responses to stimuli. Here we address this conundrum by analyzing an in vitro model of the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), a biological program implicated in increased tumor invasiveness, heterogeneity, and drug resistance. We used mass cytometry to measure EGF signaling dynamics in the ERK and AKT signaling pathways before and after induction of EMT in Py2T murine breast cancer cells. Analysis of the data with standard network inference methods suggested EMT-dependent network rewiring. In contrast, use of a modeling approach that adequately accounts for single-cell variation demonstrated that a single reaction-based pathway model with constant structure and near-constant parameters is sufficient to represent differences in EGF signaling across EMT. This result indicates that rewiring of the signaling network is not necessary for heterogeneous responses to a signal and that unifying reaction-based models should be employed for characterization of signaling in heterogeneous environments, such as cancer."

Different subsets of T and NK cells have long been recognized in the cHL microenvironment, yet their distinct contribution to disease pathogenesis has remained enigmatic. Very recently, novel platforms for high dimensional analysis of immune cells, such as single-cell RNA sequencing and mass cytometry, have revealed unanticipated insights into the composition of T- and NK-cell compartments in cHL. Advances in imaging techniques have better defined specific T-helper subpopulations physically interacting with neoplastic cells. In addition, the identification of novel cytotoxic subsets with an exhausted phenotype, typically enriched in cHL milieu, is shedding light on previously unrecognized immune evasion mechanisms. This review examines the immunological features and the functional properties of T and NK subsets recently identified in the cHL microenvironment, highlighting their pathological interplay with HRS cells.

Mass cytometry reagents are probes tagged with metal isotopes of defined mass and act as reporters. Metals are detected using inductively coupled plasma time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ICP-TOF-MS). Many different types of mass-tag reagents have been developed to afford myriad applications. We have classified these compounds into polymer-based mass-tag reagents, nonpolymer-based mass-tag reagents, and inorganic nanoparticles. Metal-chelating polymers (MCPs) are widely used to profile and quantify cellular biomarkers; however, both the range of metals that can be detected and the metal signals have to be improved. Several strategies such as the inclusion of chelating agents or highly branched polymers may overcome these issues. Biocompatible materials such as polystyrene and inorganic nanoparticles are also of profound interest in mass cytometry. While polystyrene allows the inclusion of a wide variety of metals, the high metal content of inorganic nanoparticles offers an excellent opportunity to increase the signal from the metals to detect low-abundance biomarkers. Nonpolymer-based mass-tag reagents offer multiple applications: cell detection, cell cycle property determination, biomarker detection, and mass-tag cellular barcoding (MCB). Recent developments have been achieved in live cell barcoding by targeting proteins (CD45, b2m, and CD298), by using small and nonpolar probes or by ratiometric barcoding. From this perspective, the principal applications, strengths, and shortcomings of mass-tag reagents are highlighted, summarized, and discussed, with special emphasis on mass-tag reagents for MCB. Thereafter, the future perspectives of mass-tag reagents are discussed considering the current state-of-the-art technologies."

In this study, we analyzed PBMCs from human participants immunized with influenza vaccine, using high-dimensional single-cell proteomic immune profiling by mass cytometry. Data were analyzed using a novel clustering algorithm, denoised ragged pruning, to define possible influenza virus-specific clusters of CD4+ T cells. Denoised ragged pruning identified six clusters of cells. Among these, one cluster (Cluster 3) was found to increase in abundance following stimulation with influenza virus peptide ex vivo. A separate cluster (Cluster 4) was found to expand in abundance between days 0 and 7 postvaccination, indicating that it is vaccine responsive. We examined the expression profiles of all six clusters to characterize their lineage, functionality, and possible role in the response to influenza vaccine. Clusters 3 and 4 consisted of effector memory cells, with high CD154 expression. Cluster 3 expressed cytokines like IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNF-α, whereas Cluster 4 expressed IL-17. Interestingly, some participants had low abundance of Clusters 3 and 4, whereas others had higher abundance of one of these clusters compared with the other. Taken together, we present an approach for identifying novel influenza virus-reactive CD4+ T cell subsets, a method that could help advance understanding of the immune response to influenza, predict responsiveness to vaccines, and aid in better vaccine design."

Although repetitive, cognate TCR signaling is recognized as the primary driving force behind this phenomenon, and it remains unknown what other forces drive T cell exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, we show that activation of the self-ligand SLAMF7 immune receptor on T cells induced STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation, expression of multiple inhibitory receptors, and transcription factors associated with T cell exhaustion. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed that SLAMF7 transcript levels were strongly correlated with various inhibitory receptors and that high SLAMF7 expression was indicative of poor survival in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Targeted reanalysis of a CyTOF dataset, which profiled the TME in 73 ccRCC patients, revealed cell-type-specific SLAMF7 expression patterns, strong correlations between exhausted T cells and SLAMF7+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and a unique subset of SLAMF7highCD38high TAMs. These SLAMF7highCD38high TAMs showed the strongest correlations with exhausted T cells and were an independent prognostic factor in ccRCC. Confirmatory ex vivo coculture studies validated that SLAMF7-SLAMF7 interactions between murine TAMs and CD8+ T cells induce expression of multiple inhibitory receptors. Finally, mice lacking SLAMF7 show restricted growth of B16-F10 tumors, and CD8+ T cells from these mice express less PD-1 and TOX and exhibited an impaired ability to progress through the exhaustion developmental trajectory to terminal exhaustion. These findings suggest that SLAMF7 might play an important role in modulating T cell function in the TME."

The ability of NK cells to rapidly recognize and kill virally infected cells is regulated by their expression of germline-encoded inhibitory and activating receptors. The engagement of these receptors by their cognate ligands on target cells determines whether the intercellular interaction will result in NK cell killing. This protocol details the design and optimization of two complementary mass cytometry (CyTOF) panels. One panel was designed to phenotype NK cells based on receptor expression. The other panel was designed to interrogate expression of known ligands for NK cell receptors on several immune cell subsets. Together, these two panels allow for the profiling of the human NK cell receptor-ligand repertoire. Furthermore, this protocol also details the process by which we stain samples for CyTOF. This process has been optimized for improved reproducibility and standardization. An advantage of CyTOF is its ability to measure over 40 markers in each panel, with minimal signal overlap, allowing researchers to capture the breadth of the NK cell receptor-ligand repertoire. Palladium barcoding also reduces inter-sample variation, as well as consumption of reagents, making it easier to stain samples with each panel in parallel. Limitations of this protocol include the relatively low throughput of CyTOF and the inability to recover cells after analysis. These panels were designed for the analysis of clinical samples from patients suffering from acute and chronic viral infections, including dengue virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and influenza. However, they can be utilized in any setting to investigate the human NK cell receptor-ligand repertoire. Importantly, these methods can be applied broadly to the design and execution of future CyTOF panels."

While traditionally perceived as macrophage- and foam cell-dominated disease, it is now established that atherosclerosis is a partial autoimmune disease that involves the recognition of peptides from ApoB (apolipoprotein B), the core protein of LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol particles, by CD4+ T-helper cells and autoantibodies against LDL and ApoB. Autoimmunity in the atherosclerotic plaque has long been understood as a pathogenic T-helper type-1 driven response with proinflammatory cytokine secretion. Recent developments in high-parametric cell immunophenotyping by mass cytometry, single-cell RNA-sequencing, and in tools exploring antigen-specificity have established the existence of several unforeseen layers of T-cell diversity with mixed TH1 and T regulatory cells transcriptional programs and unpredicted fates. These findings suggest that pathogenic ApoB-reactive T cells evolve from atheroprotective and immunosuppressive CD4+ T regulatory cells that lose their protective properties over time. Here, we discuss T-cell heterogeneity in atherosclerosis with a focus on plasticity, antigen-specificity, exhaustion, maturation, tissue residency, and its potential use in clinical prediction."

There have been significant improvements in risk modification, treatments, and mortality; however, our ability to detect asymptomatic disease for early intervention remains limited. Recent discoveries regarding the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis have prompted investigation into new methods of diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery disease. This article reviews some of the highlights of the important developments in cardioimmunology and summarizes the clinical evidence linking the immune system and atherosclerosis. It provides an overview of the major serological biomarkers that have been associated with atherosclerosis, noting the limitations of these markers attributable to low specificity, and then contrasts these serological markers with the circulating immune cell subtypes that have been found to be altered in coronary artery disease. This review then outlines the technique of mass cytometry and its ability to provide high-dimensional single-cell data and explores how this high-resolution quantification of specific immune cell subpopulations may assist in the diagnosis of early atherosclerosis in combination with other complimentary techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing. We propose that this improved specificity has the potential to transform the detection of coronary artery disease in its early phases, facilitating targeted preventative approaches in the precision medicine era."

UBC9 is the sole conjugating enzyme in sumoylation and plays a pivotal role in maintaining homeostasis and restraining stress reactions. However, the clinical significance and function of UBC9 in bladder cancer remain unclear. In this study, immunohistochemistry was used to determine the expression of UBC9. UBC9 knock-down and SUMO inhibition were conducted followed by proliferation, migration, and cell cycle assays. RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis were used to identify potential mechanisms of UBC9. Cytokine membrane antibody array was used to detect the expression of cytokine. The mass cytometry TOF (CyTOF) was used to explore the association between bladder cancer stem cell-like population and UBC9 expression. Our results showed that UBC9 played a dual role in bladder cancer. UBC9 was up-regulated in bladder cancer, but was negatively correlated with TNM stage and grade. Knocking-down of UBC9 resulted in dramatic activation of inflammatory gene expression, which might cause inhibition of cell proliferation and inducing cell apoptosis. IL6 was the hub gene in UBC9 regulatory network. Markedly up-regulated IL6 after knocking-down of UBC9 activated the expression of CD44, which was a prominent marker of cancer stem cells. Thus, our results revealed an important and previously undescribed role for UBC9 in modulation of inflammatory signaling of bladder cancer. UBC9 in bladder cancer cells is required to maintain high sumoylation levels and alleviate stress-related inflammation threats to cell survival. Lacking UBC9 contributes to inflammation activation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stem cell-like population formation, leading to cancer progression."

MS lesions are enriched with monocyte-derived macrophages and brain-resident microglia that, together, are likely responsible for much of the immune-mediated neurotoxicity. However, microglia and macrophage also have documented neuroprotective and regenerative roles, suggesting a potential diversity in their functions. Linked with microglial functional diversity, they take on diverse phenotypes developmentally, regionally and across disease conditions. Advances in technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing and mass cytometry of immune cells has led to dramatic developments in understanding the phenotypic changes of microglia and macrophages. This review highlights the origins of microglia, their heterogeneity throughout normal ageing and their contribution to pathology and repair, with a specific focus on autoimmunity and MS. As phenotype dictates function, the emerging heterogeneity of microglia and macrophage populations in MS offers new insights into the potential immune mechanisms that result in inflammation and regeneration."

We showed that the frequency of CD45+ CD8+ and CD4+ T cells was directly proportional to the size of HIV-1 reservoir; HR patients had a significantly larger frequency of blood CD45high T cells and higher CD45 expression on both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. CD45 is a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase essential in TCR signaling. Functional and phenotypical analysis of CD45high cells revealed that they express activation and proliferation markers (CD38 + HLA-DR + and Ki-67) and produce cytokines upon in vitro activation. CD45high T cells also expressed high levels of immune check-point PD-1. Our results link CD45 expression on T cells to HIV-1 reservoir; PD-1 expression on CD45high T cells may contribute to their exhaustion."

A co-regulation between major conventional T-cell subsets and their respective CD3+ CD56+ cell counterparts appeared restricted to CD8+ , MAIT, and TCRγδ+ T-cell compartments. Interestingly, we find a co-regulation of several CD3+ CD56+ cell subsets in allergic but not in healthy individuals. Moreover, using FlowSOM, we distinguished a variety of CD56+ T-cell phenotypes demonstrating a hitherto underestimated heterogeneity among these cells. The novel CD3+ CD56+ subset description comprises phenotypes superimposed with naive, memory, type 1, 2, and 17 differentiation stages, in part represented by a phenotypical continuum. Frequencies of two out of 19 CD3+ CD56+ FlowSOM clusters were significantly diminished in allergic individuals, demonstrating less frequent presence of cells with cytolytic, presumably protective, capacity in these donors consistent with defective expansion or their recruitment to the affected tissue. Our results contribute to defining specific cell populations to be targeted during therapy for allergic conditions."

We analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the search for immune signatures and biomarkers related to psoriasis severity and treatment effect. Thirty-two patients with psoriasis and 10 matched healthy controls were included. PBMCs were collected before and after initiation of anti-TNF, anti-IL-17 or anti-IL-12/23 treatment and analyzed utilizing 26-parameter mass cytometry. The number of circulating Th17, Th22, Th9, and cytotoxic T cells were increased in severe psoriasis. Intracellular pp38 and pERK in T helper cells were associated with disease severity. Differences between responders and nonresponders regarding cell composition and intracellular signaling were identifiable already at inclusion. Biological treatment induced memory cells, restored inhibitory PD-1 function of T cells, and reduced a potential pro-atherogenic profile in monocytes. In conclusion, these results indicate amelioration of systemic inflammation in psoriasis after biological treatment. Such broad immune profiling may enable prospective stratification of patients regarding future treatment response. Successful early intervention may lead to a healthier trajectory with favorable implications on later comorbidities."

However, the phenotype of circulating EPCs remains elusive but they are more often described as CD34+KDR+. The aim of the study was to extensively characterize circulating potential vasculogenic stem cell candidates in two populations of patients with cardiovascular disease by powerful multidimensional single cell complementary cytometric approaches (mass, imaging and flow). We identified cellular candidates in one patient before and after bioprosthetic total artificial heart implantation and results were confirmed in healthy peripheral and cord blood by mass cytometry. We also quantified cellular candidates in 10 patients with different COVID-19 severity. Both C-TAH implantation and COVID-19 at critical stage induce a redistribution of circulating CD34+ and CD19+ sub-populations in peripheral blood. After C-TAH implantation, circulating CD34+ progenitor cells expressed c-Kit stem marker while specific subsets CD34+CD133-/+CD45-/dimc-Kit+KDR- were mobilized. KDR was only expressed by CD19+ B-lymphocytes and CD14+ monocytes subpopulations in circulation. We confirmed by mass cytometry this KDR expression on CD19+ in healthy peripheral and cord blood, also with a VE-cadherin expression, confirming absence of endothelial lineage marker on CD34+ subtypes. In COVID-19, a significant mobilization of CD34+c-Kit+KDR- cells was observed between moderate and critical COVID-19 patients regardless CD133 or CD45 expression. In order to better evaluate EPC phenotype, we performed imaging flow cytometry measurements of immature CD34+KDR+ cells in cord blood and showed that, after elimination of non-circular events, those cells were all CD19+. During COVID-19, a significant mobilization of CD19+KDR+ per million of CD45+ cells was observed between moderate and critical COVID-19 patients regardless of CD34 expression. CD34+c-Kit+ cells are mobilized in both cardiovascular disease described here. KDR cells in peripheral blood are CD19 positive cells and are not classic vasculogenic stem and/or progenitor cells. A better evaluation of c-Kit and KDR expressing cells will lead to the redefinition of circulating endothelial progenitors.Graphical abstract Central illustration figure. Multidimensional proteomic approach of endothelial progenitors demonstrate expression of KDR restricted to CD19 cells. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are involved in cardiovascular diseases, however their phenotype remains elusive. We elucidated here EPCs phenotype by a deep characterization by multidimensional single cell complementary cytometric approaches after Bioprosthetic total artificial heart implantation and during COVID-19. We showed a redistribution of circulating CD34+ and CD19+ sub-populations in both situations. None of the immature cell population expresses KDR. Mobilized CD34+ expressed c-Kit. Imaging flow cytometry demonstrated that CD34+KDR+ cells, after elimination of non-circular events, are all CD19+. Our results suggest a new definition of circulating EPCs and emphasize involvement of CD19 cells in cardiovascular disease."

Through CyTOF and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), we classified these four PBG subpopulations as (I) CD16lowFcεRIhighCD244high (88.5 ± 1.2%), (II) CD16highFcεRIhighCD244high (9.1 ± 0.4%), (III) CD16lowFcεRIlowCD244low (2.3 ± 1.3), and (IV) CD16highFcεRIlowCD244low (0.4 ± 0.1%). Prospective isolation confirmed basophilic-morphology of PBG I-III, but neutrophilic-morphology of PBG IV. Functional interrogation via IgE-crosslinking or IL-3 stimulation demonstrated that PBG I-II had significant increases in CD203c expression, whereas PBG III-IV remained unchanged compared with media-alone conditions. Thus, PBG III-IV could serve roles in non-IgE-mediated immunity.

This stands true for hematological malignancies as well. A considerable amount of newly developed therapies are directed against the cancer-supporting TME instead of targeting tumor cells themselves. However, the TME is often not clearly defined. In addition, the unique phenotype of each tumor and the variability among patients limit the success of such therapies. Recently, our group took advantage of the mass cytometry technology to unveil the specific TME in the context of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in mice. We found the enrichment of LAG3 and PD1, two immune checkpoints. We tested an antibody-based immunotherapy, targeting these two molecules. This combination of antibodies was successful in the treatment of murine CLL. In this methods article, we provide a detailed protocol for the staining of CLL TME cells aiming at their characterization using mass cytometry.

The alterations to SRL operations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic can generally be divided into three categories: (1) complete shutdown, (2) partial shutdown, and (3) uninterrupted operations. In many cases, SRLs that remained partially or fully operational during the initial wave of global infections saw a concurrent increase in COVID-19-related research coming through their facilities. This forced SRLs to make rapid adjustments to core operations at the same time as infectious disease experts were still developing recommendations for the safety of frontline medical workers. Although many SRLs already had contingency plans in place, this pandemic has highlighted the importance of having such plans for continuity of service, if possible, during a crisis. Immediate changes have occurred in the way SRLs operate due to potential virus transmission and in line with this new ""Best Practices"" have been established, that is,social distancing, remote working, and technology-based meetings and training. Many of these changes are likely to be in place for some time with the threat of further waves of infections toward the end of 2020 and into 2021. Some of these best practices, such as having many training resources recorded and available online, are likely to remain long-term. Although many changes have been made in haste, these will alter the future operations of SRLs. In addition, we have learnt how to deal with future crises that may be encountered in the workplace. © 2020 The Authors.

Analytes are detected via antibodies tagged with heavy metal and detected by using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Over the past decade, mass cytometry has proven to be a valuable method for immunophenotyping hematopoietic cells with remarkable precision in both healthy and malignant scenarios. This chapter explains in detail how to profile hematopoietic cells by using this high-dimensional multiplexed approach."

To identify immune cells affected by smoking, we use single-cell RNA sequencing on peripheral blood from smokers and nonsmokers. Transcriptomes reveal a subpopulation of FCGR3A (CD16)-expressing Natural Killer (NK)-like CD8 T lymphocytes that increase in smokers. Mass cytometry confirms elevated CD16+ CD8 T cells in smokers. Inferred as highly differentiated by pseudotime analysis, NK-like CD8 T cells express markers characteristic of effector memory re-expressing CD45RA T (TEMRA) cells. Indicative of immune aging, smokers' CD8 T cells are biased toward differentiated cells and smokers have fewer naïve cells than nonsmokers. DNA methylation-based models show that smoking dose is associated with accelerated aging and decreased telomere length, a biomarker of T cell senescence. Immune aging accompanies T cell senescence, which can ultimately lead to impaired immune function. This suggests a role for smoking-induced, senescence-associated immune dysregulation in smoking-mediated pathologies."

The phosphonate warhead of MARS116-Bt binds covalently to the serine amino acid residue S195 of the catalytic center and thereby CatG activity can be detected. This method contributes to observing the activation or inhibition status of cells during pathogenesis of diseases and enables accurate data acquisition from complex biological samples with a vast panel of cell subset markers in a single-cell resolution."

Here, we used single-cell transcriptomics and CyTOF-based single-cell protein quantification to characterize peripheral immune cells during EBOV infection in rhesus monkeys. We obtained 100,000 transcriptomes and 15,000,000 protein profiles, finding that immature, proliferative monocyte-lineage cells with reduced antigen-presentation capacity replace conventional monocyte subsets, while lymphocytes upregulate apoptosis genes and decline in abundance. By quantifying intracellular viral RNA, we identify molecular determinants of tropism among circulating immune cells and examine temporal dynamics in viral and host gene expression. Within infected cells, EBOV downregulates STAT1 mRNA and interferon signaling, and it upregulates putative pro-viral genes (e.g., DYNLL1 and HSPA5), nominating pathways the virus manipulates for its replication. This study sheds light on EBOV tropism, replication dynamics, and elicited immune response and provides a framework for characterizing host-virus interactions under maximum containment."

We hypothesised that immune deregulation associated with MPNs may affect the immune response gained following vaccinations when compared to healthy controls. Using deep immunophenotyping with high-dimensional single-cell analysis and mass cytometry we could demonstrate an altered immune response in MPN patients following vaccination. We found that prior to vaccination, MPN patients had reduced numbers of naive CD4 T cells. Furthermore, at 3-weeks and 3-months post-vaccination there was evidence of both delayed and impaired B- and T-memory cells responses. Thus, although, the immune systems of MPN patients can 'recognise' the Influenza A vaccine, the response appears inferior compared to healthy controls."

In this study, we explored the characteristic peripheral cellular profiles of patients with COVID-19 in both acute and convalescent phases by single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF). Using a combination of algorithm-guided data analyses, we identified peripheral immune cell subsets in COVID-19 and revealed CD4+ T-cell depletion, T-cell differentiation, plasma cell expansion, and the reduced antigen presentation capacity of innate immunity. Notably, COVID-19 induces a dysregulation in the balance of monocyte populations by the expansion of the monocyte subsets. Collectively, our results represent a high-dimensional, single-cell profile of the peripheral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection."

It is well known that T cells, including CD8+PD-1+ T cells, play important roles involving tumor development. However, their underlying phenotypic and functional differences of T cell subsets remain unclear. We constructed single-cell immune contexture involving approximate 20,000,000 immune cells from 15 pairs of HCC tumor and non-tumor adjacent tissues and 10 blood samples (including five of HCCs and five of healthy controls) by mass cytometry. scRNA-seq and functional analysis were applied to explore the function of cells. Multi-color fluorescence staining and tissue micro-arrays were used to identify the pathological distribution of CD8+PD-1+CD161 +/- T cells and their potential clinical implication. The differential distribution of CD8+ T cells subgroups was identified in tumor and non-tumor adjacent tissues. The proportion of CD8+PD1+CD161+ T cells was significantly decreased in tumor tissues, whereas the ratio of CD8+PD1+CD161- T cells was much lower in non-tumor adjacent tissues. Diffusion analysis revealed the distinct evolutionary trajectory of CD8+PD1+CD161+ and CD8+PD1+CD161- T cells. scRNA-seq and functional study further revealed the stronger immune activity of CD8+PD1+CD161+ T cells independent of MHC class II molecules expression. Interestingly, a similar change in the ratio of CD8+CD161+/ CD8+CD161- T cells was also found in peripheral blood samples collected from HCC cases, indicating their potential usage clinically. We here identified different distribution, function, and trajectory of CD8+PD-1+CD161+ and CD8+PD-1+CD161- T cells in tumor lesions, which provided new insights for the heterogeneity of immune environment in HCCs and also shed light on the potential target for immunotherapy."

This spatially resolved, single-cell data unravels the disordered structure of the infected and injured lung alongside the distribution of extensive immune infiltration. Neutrophil and macrophage infiltration are hallmarks of bacterial pneumonia and COVID-19, respectively. We provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infects predominantly alveolar epithelial cells and induces a localized hyper-inflammatory cell state associated with lung damage. By leveraging the temporal range of COVID-19 severe fatal disease in relation to the time of symptom onset, we observe increased macrophage extravasation, mesenchymal cells, and fibroblasts abundance concomitant with increased proximity between these cell types as the disease progresses, possibly as an attempt to repair the damaged lung tissue. This spatially resolved single-cell data allowed us to develop a biologically interpretable landscape of lung pathology from a structural, immunological and clinical standpoint. This spatial single-cell landscape enabled the pathophysiological characterization of the human lung from its macroscopic presentation to the single-cell, providing an important basis for the understanding of COVID-19, and lung pathology in general."

Despite being poorly understood, the role of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis in ARDS may provide significant insights into the immunosuppressive mechanisms that occur after ARDS. In the present study, we observed that the level of soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1), a potential activator of the PD-1 pathway, was upregulated in survivors of direct ARDS than in non-survivors. Administration of sPD-L1 in mice with direct ARDS relieved inflammatory lung injury and improved the survival rate, indicating the protective role of sPD-L1 in direct ARDS. Using high-throughput mass cytometry, we found a marked decrease in the number of lung monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) with proinflammatory markers, and the protective role of sPD-L1 diminished in ARDS mice with monocyte/macrophage depletion. Furthermore, PD-1 expression increased in the MDMs of patients and mice with direct ARDS. Finally, we showed that sPD-L1 induced MDM apoptosis in patients with direct ARDS. Taken together, our results demonstrated that the engagement of sPD-L1 on PD-1 expressing macrophages resulted in a decrease in pro-inflammatory macrophages and eventually improved direct ARDS. Our study identified a prognostic indicator for patients with direct ARDS and a potential target for therapeutic development in direct ARDS."

These cells are activated by bacterial metabolites, lipid antigens and cytokines, and are important for intestinal barrier integrity. The loss of gut homeostasis observed in HIV infection is central to disease pathogenesis, and studies have highlighted impairment of particular unconventional T-cell subsets within a specific gut compartment. However, although the small and large intestine are distinct niches, the overall impact of HIV on unconventional T-cells across the gut mucosal has not been well-studied. We hypothesized that compartment specific differences in the unconventional T-cell repertoire would exist between the small and large intestine, due to increasing bacterial loads and microbial diversity; and that the impact of HIV infection might differ depending on the compartment examined. We used mass cytometry, flow cytometry and unbiased T-cell receptor profiling to quantify unconventional T-cells in blood and tissue from the small (duodenum) and large (colon) intestine in HIV infected and uninfected participants undergoing examination for a range of intestinal conditions. Overall, we find distinct compartmentalisation of T-cells between blood, duodenum and colon, with iNKT cells significantly enriched in the duodenum and δ-1 expressing γδ T-cells in the colon. In addition, we observe greater clonal expansion of conventional TCRs in the duodenum, suggestive of stronger adaptive immunity in this compartment. Conversely, we find evidence of an expanded unconventional TCR repertoire in the colon, which contained far more overlapping ""donor unrestricted"" sequences than the duodenum. Twelve of these TCRs were highly ""MAIT-like"" and 3 were unique to the colon, suggesting an enrichment of donor unrestricted T-cells (DURTs) in this compartment. Unexpectedly, however, no significant impact of HIV infection on any of the unconventional T-cell subsets measured was observed in either mucosal site in terms of frequency or TCR repertoire. Further studies are required to investigate the importance of these unconventional T-cell subsets to intestinal homeostasis within the different gut compartments and determine if they are functionally impaired during HIV infection."

We have previously shown in neonatal lung disease that the therapeutic capacity of MSCs is conferred by their secreted extracellular vesicles (MEx), which function primarily through immunomodulation. We hypothesize that MEx have significant therapeutic potential pertinent to immune-mediated gestational diseases. Of particular interest is early-onset preeclampsia, which can be caused by alterations of the maternal intrauterine immune environment. Using a heme-oxygenase-1 null mouse model of pregnancy loss with preeclampsia-like features, we examined the preventative effects of maternal MEx treatment early in pregnancy. Heme oxygenase-1 null females (Hmox1-/-) or wild-type control females were bred in homozygous matings followed by evaluation of maternal and fetal parameters. A single dose of MEx was administered intravenously on gestational day (GD)1 to Hmox1-/- females (Hmox1-/- MEx). Compared with untreated Hmox1-/- females, Hmox1-/- MEx-treated pregnancies showed significant improvement in fetal loss, intrauterine growth restriction, placental spiral artery modification, and maternal preeclamptic stigmata. Biodistribution studies demonstrated that MEx localize to a subset of cells in the preimplantation uterus. Further, mass cytometric (CyTOF) evaluation of utero-placental leukocytes in Hmox1-/- MEx versus untreated pregnancies showed alteration in the abundance, surface marker repertoire, and cytokine profiles of multiple immune populations. Our data demonstrate the therapeutic potential of MEx to optimize the intrauterine immune environment and prevent maternal and fetal sequelae of preeclamptic disease."

Using single-cell RNA sequencing and high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry, we identified eight populations of antigen-experienced CD45RA−CD4+ T cells in blood of healthy individuals including a population of GM-CSF–producing cells, known as THGM, that lacked expression of signature transcription factors and cytokines of established TH lineages. Using GM-CSF-reporter/fate reporter mice, we show that THGM cells are present in the periphery and central nervous system in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. In addition to GM-CSF, human and mouse THGM cells also expressed IL-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-3, and CCL20. THGM cells maintained their phenotype through several cycles of activation but up-regulated expression of T-bet and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) upon exposure to IL-12 in vitro and in the central nervous system of mice with autoimmune neuroinflammation. Although T-bet was not required for the development of THGM cells, it was essential for their encephalitogenicity. These findings demonstrate that THGM cells constitute a distinct population of TH cells with lineage characteristics that are poised to adopt a TH1 phenotype and promote neuroinflammation."

Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a tumor-selective particle radiation therapy. 10B(n,α)7Li capture reaction produces alpha particles whose short paths (5-9 µm) lead to selective killing of tumor cells. P-boronophenylalanine (BPA) is a chemical compound used in clinical trials for BNCT. Here, we used mass cytometry (Cytof) to investigate whether glioma stem-like cells (GSLCs) take up BPA or not. We used GSLCs, and cells differentiated from GSLCs (DCs) by fetal bovine serum. After exposure to BPA for 24 h at 25 ppm in 5% CO2 incubator, we immune-stained them with twenty stem cell markers, anti-Ki-67, anti-BPA and anti-CD98 (heterodimer that forms the large BPA transporter) antibodies and analyzed them with Cytof. The percentage of BPA+ or CD98+ cells with stem cell markers (Oct3/4, Nestin, SOX2, Musashi-1, PDGFRα, Notch2, Nanog, STAT3 and C-myc, among others) was 2-4 times larger among GSLCs than among DCs. Analyses of in vivo orthotopic tumor also indicated that 100% of SOX2+ or Nestin+ GSLCs were BPA+, whereas only 36.9% of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)+ DCs were BPA+. Therefore, GSLCs may take up BPA and could be targeted by BNCT."

Currently, preprocessing of raw files is commonly performed in independent standalone tools, which makes it difficult to reproduce. Here, we present an R pipeline based on an updated version of CATALYST that covers all preprocessing steps required for downstream mass cytometry analysis in a fully reproducible way. This new version of CATALYST is based on Bioconductor's SingleCellExperiment class and fully unit tested. The R-based pipeline includes file concatenation, bead-based normalization, single-cell deconvolution, spillover compensation and live cell gating after debris and doublet removal. Importantly, this pipeline also includes different quality checks to assess machine sensitivity and staining performance while allowing also for batch correction. This pipeline is based on open source R packages and can be easily be adapted to different study designs. It therefore has the potential to significantly facilitate the work of CyTOF users while increasing the quality and reproducibility of data generated with this technology."

As the first demonstration of the simultaneous detection of single-cell proteins and untargeted metabolites, a multi-dimensional organic mass-cytometry system was established by a simple microfluidic chip connected to a nanoelectrospray mass spectrometer, providing useful heterogeneous information about the cells. A series of mass probes with online-dissociated mass tags were developed, ensuring the semi-quantification of cell-surface proteins and the compatibility of endogenous metabolite detection at the single-cell level. Six cell surface antigens and ≈100 metabolites from three ovarian-cancer cell types and two breast-cancer cell types were successfully monitored and contributed to highly sensitive and specific cell typing. Doxorubicin-resistant cancer-cell analysis confirmed the applications in distinguishing rare cell phenotypes. The proposed system is simple, extensible, and promising for cell typing, drug-resistance analysis of tumor cells, and clinical diagnosis and therapy at the single-cell level."

Epub 2020 Nov 3.,Keywords: flow cytometry; immune monitoring; mass cytometry; whole blood preservation.,"Whole blood is often collected for large-scale immune monitoring studies to track changes in cell frequencies and responses using flow (FC) or mass cytometry (MC). In order to preserve sample composition and phenotype, blood samples should be analyzed within 24 h after bleeding, restricting the recruitment, analysis protocols, as well as biobanking. Herein, we have evaluated two whole blood preservation protocols that allow rapid sample processing and long-term stability. Two fixation buffers were used, Phosphoflow Fix and Lyse (BD) and Proteomic Stabilizer (PROT) to fix and freeze whole blood samples for up to 6 months. After analysis by an 8-plex panel by FC and a 26-plex panel by MC, manual gating of circulating leukocyte populations and cytokines was performed. Additionally, we tested the stability of a single sample over a 13-months period using 45 consecutive aliquots and a 34-plex panel by MC. We observed high correlation and low bias toward any cell population when comparing fresh and 6 months frozen blood with FC and MC. This correlation was confirmed by hierarchical clustering. Low coefficients of variation (CV) across studied time points indicate good sample preservation for up to 6 months. Cytokine detection stability was confirmed by low CVs, with some differences between fresh and fixed conditions. Thirteen months regular follow-up of PROT samples showed remarkable sample stability. Whole blood can be preserved for phenotyping and cytokine-response studies provided the careful selection of a compatible antibody panel. However, possible changes in cell morphology, differences in antibody affinity, and changes in cytokine-positive cell frequencies when compared to fresh blood should be considered. Our setting constitutes a valuable tool for multicentric and retrospective studies. © 2020 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry."

NK cells, characterized by their ability to rapidly recognize and kill virally infected cells, are activated during acute DENV infection. However, their role in viral clearance versus pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Our goal was to profile the NK cell receptor-ligand repertoire to provide further insight into the function of NK cells during pediatric and adult DENV infection. We used mass cytometry to phenotype isolate NK cells and PBMCs from a cohort of DENV-infected children and adults. Using unsupervised clustering, we found that pediatric DENV infection leads to a decrease in total NK cell frequency with a reduction in the percentage of CD56dimCD38bright NK cells and an increase in the percentage of CD56dimperforinbright NK cells. No such changes were observed in adults. Next, we identified markers predictive of DENV infection using a differential state test. In adults, NK cell expression of activation markers, including CD69, perforin, and Fas-L, and myeloid cell expression of activating NK cell ligands, namely Fas, were predictive of infection. In contrast, increased NK cell expression of the maturation marker CD57 and myeloid cell expression of inhibitory ligands, such as HLA class I molecules, were predictive of pediatric DENV infection. These findings suggest that acute pediatric DENV infection may result in diminished NK cell activation, which could contribute to enhanced pathogenesis and disease severity."

Delaying plasma or serum isolation after phlebotomy (processing delay) can cause perturbations of numerous analytes. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of how processing delay affects major endpoints used in human immunology research is necessary. Therefore, we studied how processing delay affects commonly measured cytokines and immune cell populations. We hypothesized that short-term time delays inherent to human research in serum and plasma processing impact commonly studied immunological analytes. Blood from healthy donors was subjected to processing delays commonly encountered in sample collection, and then assayed by 62-plex Luminex panel, 40-parameter mass cytometry panel, and 540,000 transcript expression microarray. Variance for immunological analytes was estimated using each individual's baseline as a control. In general, short-term processing delay led to small changes in plasma and serum cytokines (range - 10.8 to 43.5%), markers and frequencies of peripheral blood mononuclear cell phenotypes (range 0.19 to 3.54 fold), and whole blood gene expression (stable for > 20 K genes)-with several exceptions described herein.

Studies in animal models have been used to determine the origin and development of microglia, and how these cells alter their transcriptional and phenotypic signatures during CNS pathology. However, little is known about their human counterparts. Recent studies in human brain samples have harnessed the power of multiplexed single-cell technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and mass cytometry (cytometry by time-of-flight [CyTOF]) to provide a comprehensive molecular view of human microglia in healthy and diseased brains. CyTOF is a powerful tool to study high-dimensional protein expression of human microglia (huMG) at the single-cell level. This technology widens the possibilities of high-throughput quantification (of over 60 targeted molecules) at a single-cell resolution. CyTOF can be combined with scRNA-seq for comprehensive analysis, as it allows single-cell analysis of post-translational modifications of proteins, which provides insights into cell signalling dynamics in targeted cells. In addition, imaging mass cytometry (IMC) has recently become commercially available, and will be useful for analysing multiple cell types in human brain sections. IMC leverages mass spectrometry to acquire spatial data of cell-cell interactions on tissue sections, using (theoretically) over 40 markers at the same time. In this review, we summarise recent studies of huMG using CyTOF and IMC analyses. The uses and limitations as well as future directions of these technologies are discussed."

While CD4+ T cells have been extensively studied in CVD, the importance of CD8+ T cells in this disease, despite their abundance and increased activation in human atherosclerotic plaques, remains largely unknown. Thus, the objective of this study was to compare peripheral T-cell signatures between humans with a high (severe) risk of CVD (including myocardial infarction or stroke) and those with a low risk of CVD. Approach and Results: Using mass cytometry, we uncovered a naive CD8+ T (TN) cell population expressing CD95 (termed CD95+CD8+ stem cell memory T [CD8 TSCM] cells) that was enriched in patients with high compared with low CVD. This T-cell subset enrichment within individuals with high CVD was a relative increase and resulted from the loss of CD95lo cells within the TN compartment. We found that CD8 TSCM cells positively correlated with CVD risk in humans, while CD8+ TN cells were inversely correlated. Atherosclerotic apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice also displayed respective 7- and 2-fold increases in CD8+ TSCM frequencies within the peripheral blood and aorta-draining paraaortic lymph nodes compared with C57BL/6J mice. CD8+ TSCM cells were 1.7-fold increased in aortas from western diet fed ApoE-/- mice compared with normal laboratory diet-fed ApoE-/- mice. Importantly, transfer of TSCM cells into immune-deficient Rag.Ldlr recipient mice that lacked T cells increased atherosclerosis, illustrating the importance of these cells in atherogenesis."

The immunomodulatory effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can contribute to the treatment of inflammatory disorders. In previous studies, the focus was on innate immune cells and the effects of MSCs on ALI through CD8+ T cells remain unclear. In the present study, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce ALI in mice. ALI mice were treated with MSCs via intratracheal instillation. Survival rate, histopathological changes, protein levels, total cell count, cytokine levels, and chemokine levels in alveolar lavage fluid were used to determine the efficacy of MSCs. Mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) were used to characterize the CD8+ T cells in the lungs. Ly6C- CD8+ T cells are prevalent in normal mice, whereas a specialized effector phenotype expressing a high level of Ly6C is predominant in advanced disease. MSCs significantly mitigated ALI and improved survival. MSCs decreased the infiltration of CD8+ T cells, especially Ly6C+ CD8+ T cells into the lungs. Mass cytometry revealed that CD8+ T cells expressing high Ly6C and CXCR3 levels caused tissue damage in the lungs of ALI mice, which was alleviated by MSCs. The scRNA-seq showed that Ly6C+ CD8+ T cells exhibited a more activated phenotype and decreased expression of proinflammatory factors that were enriched the most in immune chemotaxis after treatment with MSCs. We showed that CD8+ T cells play an important role in MSC-mediated ALI remission, and both infiltration quantity and proinflammatory function were inhibited by MSCs, indicating a potential mechanism for therapeutic intervention."

The numbers, localization and phenotypes of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) are not only predictive of response to immunotherapy but also key modulators of disease progression. In this review, we focus on TIL profiling in cutaneous melanoma using histopathological approaches and highlight the observed prognostic value of the primary TIL subsets. The quantification of TIL in formalin-fixed tumor samples ranges from visual scoring of lymphocytic infiltrates in H&E to multiplex immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence followed by enumeration using image analysis software. Nevertheless, TIL enumeration in the current literature primarily relies upon single marker immunohistochemistry analyses of major lymphocyte subsets such as conventional T cells (CD3, CD4, CD8), regulatory T cells (FOXP3) and B cells (CD20). We review key studies in the literature on associations between TIL subsets and patient survival. We also cover recent findings with respect to the existence of ectopic lymphoid aggregates found in the TME which are termed tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) and are generally a positive prognostic feature. In addition to their prognostic significance, the existence of various TIL sub-populations has also been reported to predict a patient's response to ICB. Thus, the literature on the predictive potential of TIL subsets in melanoma patients receiving ICB has also been discussed. Finally, we describe recently developed state-of-the-art profiling approaches for tumor infiltrating immune cells such as digital pathology scoring algorithms (e.g., Immunoscore) and multiplex proteomics-based immunophenotyping platforms (e.g., imaging mass cytometry). Translating these novel technologies have the potential to revolutionize tumor immunopathology leading to altering our current understanding of cancer immunology and dramatically improving outcomes for patients."

However, they also impact the immune system, and it depends on the given context whether this is beneficial or not. The attenuated vaccinia virus strain modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) has been used as a viral vector in clinical studies intended to treat and prevent cancer and infectious diseases. The adjuvant property of MVA is thought to be due to its capability to stimulate innate immunity. Here, we confirmed that MVA induces interleukin-8 (IL-8), and this chemokine was upregulated significantly more in monocytes and HLA-DRbright dendritic cells (DCs) of HIV-infected patients on combined antiretroviral therapy (ART) than in cells of healthy persons. The effect of MVA on cell surface receptors is mostly unknown. Using mass cytometry profiling, we investigated the expression of 17 cell surface receptors in leukocytes after ex vivo infection of human whole-blood samples with MVA. We found that MVA downregulates most of the characteristic cell surface markers in particular types of leukocytes. In contrast, C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) was significantly upregulated in each leukocyte type of healthy persons. Additionally, we detected a relative higher cell surface expression of the HIV-1 co-receptors C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and CXCR4 in leukocytes of HIV-ART patients than in healthy persons. Importantly, we showed that MVA infection significantly downregulated CCR5 in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and three different DC populations. CD86, a costimulatory molecule for T cells, was significantly upregulated in HLA-DRbright DCs after MVA infection of whole blood from HIV-ART patients. However, MVA was unable to downregulate cell surface expression of CD11b and CD32 in monocytes and neutrophils of HIV-ART patients to the same extent as in monocytes and neutrophils of healthy persons. In summary, MVA modulates the expression of many different kinds of cell surface receptors in leukocytes, which can vary in cells originating from persons previously infected with other pathogens."

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is the most common cause of death among SSc patients and there are currently very limited approved disease-modifying treatment options for systemic sclerosis-related interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD). The mechanisms underlying pulmonary fibrosis in SSc-ILD are not completely unraveled, and knowledge on fibrotic processes has been acquired mostly from studies in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The incomplete knowledge of SSc-ILD pathogenesis partly explains the limited options for disease-modifying therapy for SSc-ILD. Fibrosis in IPF appears to be related to aberrant repair following injury, but whether this also holds for SSc-ILD is less evident. Furthermore, immune dysregulation appears to contribute to pro-fibrotic responses in SSc-ILD, perhaps more than in IPF. In addition, SSc-ILD patient heterogeneity complicates the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of disease development, and more importantly, limits correct clinical diagnosis and treatment effectivity. Therefore, there is an unmet need for patient-relevant (in vitro) models to examine patient-specific disease pathogenesis, predict disease progression, screen appropriate treatment regimens and identify new targets for treatment. Technological advances in in vitro patient-relevant disease modeling, including (human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived) lung epithelial cells, organoids and organ-on-chip technology offer a platform that has the potential to contribute to unravel the underlying mechanisms of SSc-ILD development. Combining these models with state-of-the-art analysis platforms, including (single cell) RNA sequencing and (imaging) mass cytometry, may help to delineate pathogenic mechanisms and define new treatment targets of SSc-ILD."

We present the clinical course and immunological work-up of an adult patient who presented in adolescent years with an atypical gastrointestinal phenotype and was diagnosed more than two decades later with a monogenic disorder with important therapeutic implications. Methods: Whole exome sequencing was performed in a 37-years-old patient with a history of diarrhea since adolescence. Sanger sequencing was used to validate the suspected variant. Mass cytometry (CyTOF) and flow cytometry were conducted on peripheral blood mononuclear cells for deep immunophenotyping. Next-generation sequencing of the TCRB and IgH was performed for global immune repertoire analysis of circulating lymphocytes. Results: We identified a novel deleterious c.1455C>A (p.Y485X) mutation in LRBA. CyTOF studies demonstrated significant changes in immune landscape in the LRBA-deficient patient, including an increase in myeloid derived suppressor cells and double-negative T cells, decreased B cells, low ratio of naïve:memory T cells, and reduced capacity of T cells to secrete various cytokines following stimulation, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ). In addition, this patient exhibited low frequency of regulatory T cells, with a reduction in their CTLA4 expression and interleukin (IL)-10 secretion. Finally, we show marked oligoclonal expansion of specific B- and T-cell clones in the peripheral blood of the LRBA-deficient patient. Conclusions: LRBA deficiency is characterized by marked immunological changes in innate and adaptive immune cells. This case highlights the importance of advanced genetic studies in patients with a unique phenotype, regardless of their age at presentation."

Here, we review the five common 'digital cytometry' methods: deconvolution of RNA-Seq, cell-type identification by estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT), CIBERSORTx, single sample gene set enrichment analysis and single-sample scoring of molecular phenotypes deconvolution method. The results show that CIBERSORTx B-mode, which uses batch correction to adjust the gene expression profile of the bulk of cells ('mixture data') to eliminate possible cross-platform variations between the mixture data and the gene expression data of single cells ('signature matrix'), outperforms other methods, especially when signature matrix and mixture data come from different platforms. However, in our tests, CIBERSORTx S-mode, which uses batch correction for adjusting the signature matrix instead of mixture data, did not perform better than the original CIBERSORT method, which does not use any batch correction method. This result suggests the need for further investigations into how to utilize batch correction in deconvolution methods."

As latently infected cells cannot be phenotyped directly, the features of the in vivo reservoir have remained elusive. Here, we describe a method that leverages high-dimensional phenotyping using CyTOF to trace latently infected cells reactivated ex vivo to their original pre-activation states. Our results suggest that, contrary to common assumptions, the reservoir is not randomly distributed among cell subsets, and is remarkably conserved between individuals. However, reservoir composition differs between tissues and blood, as do cells successfully reactivated by different latency reversing agents. By selecting 8-10 of our 39 original CyTOF markers, we were able to isolate highly purified populations of unstimulated in vivo latent cells. These purified populations were highly enriched for replication-competent and intact provirus, transcribed HIV, and displayed clonal expansion. The ability to isolate unstimulated latent cells from infected individuals enables previously impossible studies on HIV persistence."

TTE cells are heterogeneous in all subjects, with BM containing both CD69- and CD69+ subsets, while only CD69- cells are found in PB. Within the BM-TTE compartment, CD69- and CD69+ cells are found in comparable proportions in controls, while CD69- cells are dominant in MGUS and SMM and predominantly either CD69- or CD69+ cells in NDMM. A positive relationship between CD69+TTE and CD69-TTE cells is observed in the BM of controls, lost in MGUS, and converted to an inverse relationship in NDMM. CD69-TTE cells include multiple oligoclonal expansions of T-cell receptor/Vβ families shared between BM and PB of NDMM. Oligoclonal expanded CD69-TTE cells from the PB include myeloma-reactive cells capable of killing autologous CD38hi plasma cells in vitro, involving degranulation and high expression of perforin and granzyme. In contrast to CD69-TTE cells, oligoclonal expansions are not evident within CD69+TTE cells, which possess low perforin and granzyme expression and high inhibitory checkpoint expression and resemble T resident memory cells. Both CD69-TTE and CD69+TTE cells from the BM of NDMM produce large amounts of the inflammatory cytokines interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor α. The balance between CD69- and CD69+ cells within the BM-TTE compartment may regulate immune responses in NDMM and contribute to the clinical heterogeneity of the disease."

Paradigmatic studies have demonstrated that circulating memory cells can be further divided into effector memory (Tem) and central memory (Tcm) populations based on discrete functional characteristics. Following resolution of infection, we identified a persisting antigen-specific CD8 T cell population that was terminally fated with potent effector function but maintained memory T cell qualities and conferred robust protection against reinfection. Notably, this terminally differentiated effector memory CD8 T cell population (terminal-Tem) was conflated within the conventional Tem population, prompting redefinition of the classical characteristics of Tem cells. Murine terminal-Tem were transcriptionally, functionally, and developmentally unique compared to Tem cells. Through mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses of human peripheral blood from healthy individuals, we also identified an analogous terminal-Tem population of CD8 T cells that was transcriptionally distinct from Tem and Tcm Key findings from this study show that parsing of terminal-Tem from conventionally defined Tem challenge the reported characteristics of Tem biology, including enhanced presence in lymphoid tissues, robust IL-2 production, and recall potential, greater than expected homeostatic fitness, refined transcription factor dependencies, and a distinct molecular phenotype. Classification of terminal-Tem and clarification of Tem biology hold broad implications for understanding the molecular regulation of memory cell states and harnessing immunological memory to improve immunotherapies."

The internalized NPs in unicellular organisms could travel to human bodies along food chains and raise health concerns. Current research failed to determine the characteristics of cellular uptake of NPs by unicellular organisms at extremely low concentration in the real environment. We here developed a label-free high-throughput mass cytometry method to investigate gold NP (AuNP) uptake in a unicellular organism (Tetrahymena thermophila) at the single-cell level. The limit of detection for Au is as low as to 6.67 × 10-18 g/cell, which equals ∼5.3 5 nm AuNPs. We demonstrated that active engulfment pathways were responsible for the cellular accumulation of AuNPs and T. thermophila could also eliminate the cellular AuNPs rapidly. The interaction between AuNPs and T. thermophila is highly dependent on the sizes of nanoparticles; i.e., the population of T. thermophila containing AuNPs decreased with the increment of the diameters of AuNPs when exposed to the same mass concentration. For each type of AuNP, distinct heterogeneous cellular uptake of AuNPs by T. thermophila was observed. Intriguingly, for 5 nm AuNP, even at 0.001 ng/mL, some T. thermophila cells could concentrate AuNPs, indicating a real environmental concern even when water was contaminated by only trace level of NPs. This method represents a promising tool for simultaneous determination of physiological status of cells together with the intracellular level of heavy metal or metallic NPs in study of biological effects."

The main aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of HIV infection on human AM and to compare the effect of smoking on their phenotype and function. Time-of-flight mass cytometry and RNA sequencing were used to characterize macrophages from human bronchoalveolar lavage of HIV-infected and -uninfected smokers and nonsmokers. We found that the frequency of CD163+ anti-inflammatory AM was decreased, whereas CD163-CCR7+ proinflammatory AM were increased in HIV infection. HIV-mediated proinflammatory polarization was associated with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and macrophage activation. Conversely, smoking heightened the inflammatory response evident by change in the expression of CXCR4 and TLR4. Altogether, these findings suggest that HIV infection, along with cigarette smoke, favors a proinflammatory macrophage phenotype associated with enhanced expression of inflammatory molecules. Further, this study highlights time-of-flight mass cytometry as a reliable method for immunophenotyping the highly autofluorescent cells present in the bronchoalveolar lavage of cigarette smokers."

In major depressive disorder (MDD), elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines can be found in peripheral blood, but very little is known about the changes that occur directly in the brain. Microglia are the primary immune effector cells of the central nervous system and exquisitely sensitive to changes in the brain microenvironment. Here, we performed the first single-cell analysis of microglia from four different post-mortem brain regions (frontal lobe, temporal lobe, thalamus, and subventricular zone) of medicated individuals with MDD compared to controls. We found no evidence for the induction of inflammation-associated molecules, such as CD11b, CD45, CCL2, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF, MIP-1β (CCL4), IL-10, and even decreased expression of HLA-DR and CD68 in microglia from MDD cases. In contrast, we detected increased levels of the homeostatic proteins P2Y12 receptor, TMEM119 and CCR5 (CD195) in microglia from all brain regions of individuals with MDD. We also identified enrichment of non-inflammatory CD206hi macrophages in the brains of MDD cases. In sum, our results suggest enhanced homeostatic functions of microglia in MDD."

Here, we show that restraint stress leads to hyperarousal associated with strong activation of corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (CRHPVN) and hypocretin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (HcrtLH). CRHPVN neurons directly innervate HcrtLH neurons, and optogenetic stimulation of LH-projecting CRHPVN neurons elicits hyperarousal. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockdown of the crh gene in CRHPVN neurons abolishes hyperarousal induced by stimulating LH-projecting CRHPVN neurons. Genetic ablation of Hcrt neurons or crh gene knockdown significantly counteracts restraint stress-induced hyperarousal. Single-cell mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) revealed extensive changes to immune cell distribution and functional responses in peripheral blood during hyperarousal upon optogenetic stimulation of CRHPVN neurons simulating stress-induced insomnia. Our findings suggest both central and peripheral systems are synergistically engaged in the response to stress via CRHPVN circuitry."

Multiparameter immunophenotypic characterization of these cells is challenging because of their autofluorescence and diversity. We evaluated the immunophenotypic landscape of airway myeloid cells in COPD using time of flight mass cytometry. Cells from BAL, which were obtained from never-smokers (n = 8) and smokers with (n = 20) and without (n = 4) spirometric COPD, were examined using a 44-parameter time of flight mass cytometry panel. Unsupervised cluster analysis was used to identify cellular subtypes that were confirmed by manual gating. We identified major populations of CD68+ and CD68- cells with 22 distinct phenotypic clusters, of which 18 were myeloid cells. We found a higher abundance of putative recruited myeloid cells (CD68+ classical monocytes) in BAL from patients with COPD. CD68+ classical monocyte population had distinct responses to smoking and COPD that were potentially related to their recruitment from the interstitium and vasculature. We demonstrate that BAL cells from smokers and subjects with COPD have lower AXL expression. Also, among subjects with COPD, we report significant differences in the abundance of PDL1high and PDL2high clusters and in the expression of PDL1 and PDL2 across several macrophage subtypes suggesting modulation of inflammatory responses. In addition, several phenotypic differences in BAL cells from subjects with history of COPD exacerbation were identified that could inform potential disease mechanisms. Overall, we report several changes to the immunophenotypic landscape that occur with smoking, COPD, and past exacerbations that are consistent with decreased regulation and increased activation of inflammatory pathways."

Epub 2020 Sep 10.,Keywords: dendritic cell; eosinophil; inflammation; mass cytometry; neutrophil.,"Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that afflicts over 30 million individuals in the United States and over 300 million individuals worldwide. The inflammatory response in the airways is often characterized by the analysis of sputum, which contains multiple types of cells including neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and rare bronchial epithelial cells. Subtyping patients using microscopy of the sputum has identified both neutrophilic and eosinophilic infiltrates in airway inflammation. However, with the extensive heterogeneity among these cell types, a higher resolution understanding of the inflammatory cell types present in the sputum is needed to dissect the heterogeneity of disease. Improved recognition of the distinct phenotypes and sources of inflammation in asthmatic granulocytes may identify relevant pathways for clinical management or investigation of novel therapeutic mediators. Here, we employed mass cytometry or cytometry by time-of-flight to quantify frequency and define functional status of sputum derived airway cells in asthmatic patients and healthy controls. This in-depth single cell analysis method identified multiple distinct subtypes of airway immune cells, especially in neutrophils. Significance was discovered by statistical analysis as well as a data-driven unbiased clustering approach. Our multidimensional assessment method identifies differences in cellular function and supports identification of cellular status that may contribute to diverse clinical responses. This technical advance is relevant for studies of pathogenesis and may provide meaningful insights to advance our knowledge of asthmatic inflammation."

The analysis of the phenotypes and functionality of cells belonging to the immune system could clarify their role in the immunopathogenesis of HIV infection, and to elaborate key concepts, relevant in the treatment of this disease. Important discoveries have been made concerning cells that are important for protective immunity like lymphocytes that display polyfunctionality, resident memory T cells, innate lymphoid cells, to mention a few. The complex phenotype of myeloid-derived suppressor cells has been investigated, and relevant changes have been reported during chronic and primary HIV infection, in correlation with changes in CD4 T-cell number, T-cell activation, and with advanced disease stage. The search for markers of HIV persistence present in latently infected cells, namely those molecules that are important for a functional or sterilizing cure, evidenced the role of follicular helper T cells, and opened a discussion on the meaning and use of different surface molecules not only in identifying such cells, but also in designing new strategies. Finally, advanced technologies based upon the simultaneous detection of HIV-RNA and proteins at the single cell level, as well as those based upon spectral cytometry or mass cytometry are now finding new actors and depicting a new scenario in the immunopathogenesis of the infection, that will allow to better design innovative therapies based upon novel drugs and vaccines."

We detected these immune cells from the ischemic brain, peripheral blood, spleen, and bone marrow at different time courses after stroke. Our data showed (1) dynamic changes in the immune cell numbers in the ischemic brain and peripheral organs.

These technologies expanded the number of biomarkers that can be identified simultaneously by using heavy-isotope-tagged antibody reagents. Small-molecule probes bearing heavy isotopes are emerging as additional useful functional reporters of cellular features. Realizing this, we explored the iodination of DAPI to produce a heavy-atom-substituted derivative of the commonly used fluorescent DNA stain. Although exhibiting a drastically reduced fluorescence emission profile, I-DAPI retains strong binding affinity for DNA. I-DAPI was used to detect cellular DNA in MC and IMC™ assays with comparable efficiency to known Ir-containing DNA intercalators. This work suggests repurposing well-known colorimetric stains through simple reactions could be an effective strategy to develop new, functional MC and IMC™ reagents."

By detecting over 40 proteins on millions of single cells, CyTOF allows the characterisation of cell subpopulations in unprecedented detail. However, most CyTOF studies require the integration of data from multiple CyTOF batches usually acquired on different days and possibly at different sites. To date, the integration of CyTOF datasets remains a challenge due to technical differences arising in multiple batches. To overcome this limitation, we developed an approach called CytofRUV for analysing multiple CyTOF batches, which includes an R-Shiny application with diagnostic plots. CytofRUV can correct for batch effects and integrate data from large numbers of patients and conditions across batches, to confidently compare cellular changes and correlate these with clinically relevant outcomes."

Using mass cytometry and network analysis, we demonstrate that chronic LCMV infection of the GIT leads to dysregulated microbial composition, a cascade of metabolic alterations, increased susceptibility to GI disease, and a system-wide recalibration of immune composition that defines viral persistence. Chronic infection led to outgrowth of activated Tbet-expressing T reg cell populations unique to the GIT and the rapid erosion of pathogen-specific CD8 tissue-resident memory T cells. Mechanistically, T reg cells and coinhibitory receptors maintained long-term viral sanctuary within the GIT, and their targeting reactivated T cells and eliminated this viral reservoir. Thus, our data provide a high-dimensional definition of the mechanisms of immune regulation that chronic viruses implement to exploit the unique microenvironment of the GIT and identify T reg cells as key modulators of viral persistence in the intestinal tract."

The antagonistic nature of their function is dependent on their subset heterogeneity and biphasic response following injury. New advancements in single-cell transcriptomics and mass cytometry have allowed us to identify smaller, transcriptionally distinct clusters that may have functional relevance in disease and homeostasis. Additionally, recent insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of monocytes following ischemic injury and their subsequent interactions with the endothelium and other immune cells reveal a complex interplay between monocytes and the cardiac milieu.

We used mass cytometry to phenotypically profile NK cells from a cohort of Beninese sex workers and healthy controls. We found that NK cells from HESN women had increased expression of NKG2A, NKp30 and LILRB1, as well as the Fc receptor CD16, and decreased expression of DNAM-1, CD94, Siglec-7, and NKp44. Using functional assessments of NK cells from healthy donors against autologous HIV-infected CD4+ T cells, we observed that NKp30+ and Siglec-7+ cells had improved functional activity. Further, we found that NK cells from HESN women trended towards increased antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity; this activity correlated with increased CD16 expression. Overall, we identify features of NK cells in HESN women that may contribute to protection from HIV infection. Follow up studies with larger cohorts are warranted to confirm these findings."

We inhibited IL17/IL17RA signaling using pharmacological and genetic strategies alongside mass cytometry and multiplex immunofluorescence techniques. We uncovered that IL17 recruits neutrophils, triggers neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and excludes cytotoxic CD8 T cells from tumors. Additionally, IL17 blockade increases immune checkpoint blockade (PD-1, CTLA4) sensitivity. Inhibition of neutrophils or Padi4-dependent NETosis phenocopies IL17 neutralization. NMR spectroscopy revealed changes in tumor lactate as a potential early biomarker for IL17/PD-1 combination efficacy.

We aimed to prospectively study cancer patients and oncology healthcare workers for COVID19 serology. In IgG+ cases, immune profile was determined to portray the pattern of immune response to SARS-CoV2. Methods: Cancer patients on active treatment and healthcare workers were enrolled. During the study period (3/2020-6/2020), demographic data and blood were collected at three time points. Expression of IgG, IgM, and IgA were assessed. In SARS-CoV-2 IgG+ cases and matched negative cases, we performed mass cytometry time of flight (CyTOF) analysis on the basis of the expression of surface markers. Results: The study included 164 cancer patients on active intravenous treatment and 107 healthcare workers at the cancer center. No symptomatic cases were reported during the study period. Serology analysis revealed four IgG+ patients (2.4%) and two IgG+ healthcare workers (1.9%)-all were asymptomatic. CyTOF analysis demonstrated substantial reduction in myeloid cells in healthcare workers who were SARS-CoV-2 IgG+ compared to those who were SARS-CoV-2 IgG-, whereas in cancer patients, the reduction was relatively milder (≈50% reduction in SARS-CoV-2 IgG+ cancer patients compared with ≈90% reduction in SARS-CoV-2 IgG+ workers). Conclusion: Our results indicate a similar rate of asymptomatic COVID19 infection in cancer patients and healthcare workers in a longitudinal study throughout the pandemic time. Due to differential immune cell profiles of cancer patients who are treated with immunomodulatory agents, the host response to the SARS-COV2 may play a role in COVID19 course and representation.

Results: The study was halted at the interim analysis as none of the 10 patients achieved the primary endpoint, but 30% of patients demonstrated a >50% reduction in PSA, with one patient achieving a >90% reduction in PSA. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) examined by mass cytometry showed that patients with clinical responses had an increase in effector memory T-cell subsets as well as an increase in T-cell expression of T-bet, suggesting induction of a Th1 response. Conclusions: This study provides further evidence that ipilimumab has activity in some patients with prostate cancer and provides further rationale for the development of future studies aimed at identifying a subset of patients with CPRC that are more likely to derive a benefit from treatment with ipilimumab. Implications for Practice: There is insufficient evidence to use ipilimumab in prostate cancer in routine practice. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01498978.

TAMs are crucial drivers of tumor progression, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Intra- and inter-tumoral spatial heterogeneities are potential keys to understanding the relationships between subpopulations of TAMs and their functions. Antitumor M1-like and pro-tumor M2-like TAMs coexist within tumors, and the opposing effects of these M1/M2 subpopulations on tumors directly impact current strategies to improve antitumor immune responses. Recent studies have found significant differences among monocytes or macrophages from distinct tumors, and other investigations have explored the existence of diverse TAM subsets at the molecular level. In this review, we discuss emerging evidence highlighting the redefinition of TAM subpopulations and functions in the TME and the possibility of separating macrophage subsets with distinct functions into antitumor M1-like and pro-tumor M2-like TAMs during the development of tumors. Such redefinition may relate to the differential cellular origin and monocyte and macrophage plasticity or heterogeneity of TAMs, which all potentially impact macrophage biomarkers and our understanding of how the phenotypes of TAMs are dictated by their ontogeny, activation status, and localization. Therefore, the detailed landscape of TAMs must be deciphered with the integration of new technologies, such as multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC), mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF), single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, and systems biology approaches, for analyses of the TME."

The sex-specific immune response to both injury and persistent pain remains underexplored and would inform treatment paradigms. We utilized high-dimensional mass cytometry to perform a comprehensive analysis of phenotypic and functional immune system differences between male and female mice after orthopedic injury. Multivariate modeling of innate and adaptive immune cell responses after injury using an elastic net algorithm, a regularized regression method, revealed sex-specific divergence at 12 h and 7 days after injury with a stronger immune response to injury in females. At 12 h, females upregulated STAT3 signaling in neutrophils but downregulated STAT1 and STAT6 signals in T regulatory cells, suggesting a lack of engagement of immune suppression pathways by females. Furthermore, at 7 days females upregulated MAPK pathways (p38, ERK, NFkB) in CD4T memory cells, setting up a possible heightened immune memory of painful injury. Taken together, our findings provide the first comprehensive and functional analysis of sex-differences in the immune response to painful injury."

Association of T and B cell subsets has been reported in SSc; however, there is lack of systematic studies of functional relations between immune cell subsets in this disease. This lack of mechanistic knowledge hampers targeted intervention. In the current study we sought to determine differential immune cell composition and their interactions in peripheral blood of SSc patients. Mononuclear cells from blood of SSc patients (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 10) were analyzed by mass cytometry using a 36-marker (cell surface and intracellular) panel. Transcriptome analysis (m-RNA sequencing) was performed on sorted T and B cell subsets. Unsupervised clustering analysis revealed significant differences in the frequencies of T and B cell subsets in patients. Correlation network analysis highlighted an overall dysregulated immune architecture coupled with domination of inflammatory senescent T cell modules in SSc patients. Transcriptome analysis of sorted immune cells revealed an activated phenotype of CD4 and mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in patients, accompanied by increased expression of inhibitory molecules, reminiscent of phenotype exhibited by functionally adapted, exhausted T cells in response to chronic stimulation. Overall, this study provides an in-depth analysis of the systemic immunome in SSc, highlighting the potential pathogenic role of inflammation and chronic stimulation-mediated ""functional adaptation"" of immune cells."

However, there is still a large proportion of patients exhibiting limited or no responses to immunotherapeutic strategy, some of which were even observed with hyperprogressive disease. One major obstacle restricting the efficacy is that tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells, which are central for tumor control, undergo exhaustion, and lose their ability to eliminate cancer cells after infiltrating into the strongly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Thus, as a potential therapeutic rationale in the development of cancer immunotherapy, targeting or reinvigorating exhausted CD8+ T cells has been attracting much interest. Hitherto, both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that govern CD8+ T-cell exhaustion have been explored. Specifically, the transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes have been depicted utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing or mass cytometry (CyTOF). In addition, cellular metabolism dictating the tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T-cell fate is currently under investigation. A series of clinical trials are being carried out to further establish the current strategies targeting CD8+ T-cell exhaustion. Taken together, despite the proven benefit of immunotherapy in cancer patients, additional efforts are still needed to fully circumvent limitations of exhausted T cells in the treatment. In this review, we will focus on the current cellular and molecular understanding of metabolic changes, epigenetic remodeling, and transcriptional regulation in CD8+ T-cell exhaustion and describe hypothetical treatment approaches based on immunotherapy aiming at reinvigorating exhausted CD8+ T cells."

To date, the phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells remain poorly defined. Using 38-parameter CyTOF, we phenotyped longitudinal specimens of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from nine individuals who recovered from mild COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells were exclusively Th1 cells and predominantly Tcm cells with phenotypic features of robust helper function. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells were predominantly Temra cells in a state of less terminal differentiation than most Temra cells. Subsets of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells express CD127, can proliferate homeostatically, and can persist for over 2 months. Our results suggest that long-lived and robust T cell immunity is generated following natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and support an important role of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in host control of COVID-19."

Cytokine-induced memory-like (ML) NK cellular therapy is safe and induces remissions in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the dynamic changes in phenotype that occur after NK-cell transfer that affect patient outcomes remain unclear. Here, we report comprehensive multidimensional correlates from ML NK cell-treated patients with AML using mass cytometry. These data identify a unique in vivo differentiated ML NK-cell phenotype distinct from conventional NK cells. Moreover, the inhibitory receptor NKG2A is a dominant, transcriptionally induced checkpoint important for ML, but not conventional NK-cell responses to cancer. The frequency of CD8α+ donor NK cells is negatively associated with AML patient outcomes after ML NK therapy. Thus, elucidating the multidimensional dynamics of donor ML NK cells in vivo revealed critical factors important for clinical response, and new avenues to enhance NK-cell therapeutics. SIGNIFICANCE: Mass cytometry reveals an in vivo memory-like NK-cell phenotype, where NKG2A is a dominant checkpoint, and CD8α is associated with treatment failure after ML NK-cell therapy.

The endogenous T-cell immunity and genetically edited cell therapies (CAR-T) failed to prevent tumor immune evasion. The effector T-cell activity is perturbed by an imbalance between inhibitory and stimulatory signals causing a reprogramming in metabolism and the high levels of multiple inhibitory receptors like programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (TIM-3), and Lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (Lag-3). Despite the efforts to neutralize inhibitory receptors by a single agent or combinatorial immune checkpoint inhibitors to boost effector function, PDAC remains unresponsive to these therapies, suggesting that multiple molecular mechanisms play a role in stimulating the exhaustion state of tumor-infiltrating T cells. Recent studies utilizing transcriptomics, mass cytometry, and epigenomics revealed a critical role of Thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group box protein (TOX) genes and TOX-associated pathways, driving T-cell exhaustion in chronic infection and cancer. Here, we will review recently defined molecular, genetic, and cellular factors that drive T-cell exhaustion in PDAC. We will also discuss the effects of available immune checkpoint inhibitors and the latest clinical trials targeting various molecular factors mediating T-cell exhaustion in PDAC."

Within the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium, we assessed the safety and efficacy of an H3.3K27M-targeted peptide vaccine.METHODSNewly diagnosed patients, aged 3-21 years, with HLA-A*02.01+ and H3.3K27M+ status were enrolled in stratum A (DIPG) or stratum B (nonpontine DMG).

Surface marker- and RNA-expression analyses, together with in vitro colony formation and in vivo adoptive humanized mouse transfers, indicate that eNePs are the earliest human neutrophil progenitors. Furthermore, we identified CD71 as a marker associated with the earliest neutrophil developmental stages. Expression of CD71 marks proliferating neutrophils, which were expanded in the blood of melanoma patients and detectable in blood and tumors from lung cancer patients.

However, how schizophrenia patient-derived microglia are affected at the phenotypic and functional level is still largely unknown. We used a recently described model to induce patient-derived microglia-like cells and used this to analyze changes in the molecular phenotype and function of myeloid cells in schizophrenia. We isolated monocytes from twenty recent-onset schizophrenia patients and twenty non-psychiatric controls. We cultured the cells towards an induced microglia-like phenotype (iMG), analyzed the phenotype of the cells by RNA sequencing and mass cytometry, and their response to LPS. Mass cytometry showed a high heterogeneity of iMG in cells derived from patients as well as controls. The prevalence of two iMG clusters was significantly higher in schizophrenia patients (adjusted p-value < 0.001). These subsets are characterized by expression of ApoE, Ccr2, CD18, CD44, and CD95, as well as IRF8, P2Y12, Cx3cr1 and HLA-DR. In addition, we found that patient-derived iMG show an enhanced response to LPS, with increased secretion of TNF-α. Further studies are needed to replicate these findings, to determine whether similar subclusters are present in schizophrenia patients in vivo, and to address how these subclusters are related to the increased response to LPS, as well as other microglial functions."

Currently, manual culture of hiPSCs is highly variable and labor-intensive posing significant challenges for high-throughput applications. Here, we established a robotic platform and automated all essential steps of hiPSC culture and differentiation under chemically defined conditions. This streamlined approach allowed rapid and standardized manufacturing of billions of hiPSCs that can be produced in parallel from up to 90 different patient-and disease-specific cell lines. Moreover, we established automated multi-lineage differentiation to generate primary embryonic germ layers and more mature phenotypes such as neurons, cardiomyocytes, and hepatocytes. To validate our approach, we carefully compared robotic and manual cell culture and performed molecular and functional cell characterizations (e.g. bulk culture and single-cell transcriptomics, mass cytometry, metabolism, electrophysiology, Zika virus experiments) in order to benchmark industrial-scale cell culture operations towards building an integrated platform for efficient cell manufacturing for disease modeling, drug screening, and cell therapy. Combining stem cell-based models and non-stop robotic cell culture may become a powerful strategy to increase scientific rigor and productivity, which are particularly important during public health emergencies (e.g. opioid crisis, COVID-19 pandemic)."

To study cancer as a complex biological system, multidimensional analyses of the tumor microenvironment are paramount. Single-cell technologies such as flow cytometry, mass cytometry, or single-cell RNA-sequencing have revolutionized our ability to characterize individual cells in great detail and, with that, shed light on the complexity of cancer microenvironments. However, a key limitation of these single-cell technologies is the lack of information on spatial context and multicellular interactions. Investigating spatial contexts of cells requires the incorporation of tissue-based techniques such as multiparameter immunofluorescence, imaging mass cytometry, or in situ detection of transcripts. In this Review, we describe the rise of multidimensional single-cell technologies and provide an overview of their strengths and weaknesses. In addition, we discuss the integration of transcriptomic, genomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and spatially-resolved data in the context of human cancers. Lastly, we will deliberate on how the integration of multi-omics data will help to shed light on the complex role of cell types present within the human tumor microenvironment, and how such system-wide approaches may pave the way toward more effective therapies for the treatment of cancer."

The mechanisms underlying this increased risk remain unknown. This study aimed to determine whether burn injury leads to sustained immune dysfunction that may underpin long-term morbidity. Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from 36 pediatric burn survivors >3 years after a non-severe burn injury (<10% total body surface area) and from age/sex-matched non-injured controls. Circulating cytokine and vaccine antibody levels were assessed using multiplex immunoassays and cell profiles compared using a panel of 40 metal-conjugated antibodies and mass cytometry. TNF-α (1.31-fold change from controls), IL-2 (1.18-fold), IL-7 (1.63-fold), and IFN-γ (1.18-fold) were all significantly elevated in the burn cohort. Additionally, burn survivors demonstrated diminished antibody responses to the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine antigens. Comparisons between groups using unsupervised clustering identified differences in proportions of clusters within T-cells, B-cells and myeloid cells. Manual gating confirmed increased memory T-regulatory and central memory CD4+ T-cells, with altered expression of T-cell, B-cell, and dendritic cell markers. Conclusions: This study demonstrates a lasting change to the immune profile of pediatric burn survivors, and highlights the need for further research into post-burn immune suppression and regulation."

We recently developed a simple and robust microfluidic platform, DropMap, to measure simultaneously the kinetics of secretion and other cellular characteristics, including endocytosis activity, viability and expression of cell-surface markers, from tens of thousands of single immune cells. Single cells are compartmentalized in 50-pL droplets and analyzed using fluorescence microscopy combined with an immunoassay based on fluorescence relocation to paramagnetic nanoparticles aligned to form beadlines in a magnetic field. The protocol typically takes 8-10 h after preparation of microfluidic chips and chambers, which can be done in advance. By contrast, enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT), flow cytometry, time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF), and single-cell sequencing enable only end-point measurements and do not enable direct, quantitative measurement of secreted proteins. We illustrate how this system can be used to profile downregulation of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secretion by single monocytes in septic shock patients, to study immune responses by measuring rates of cytokine secretion from single T cells, and to measure affinity of antibodies secreted by single B cells."

To address this gap in knowledge, cells isolated from human terminal ileum exposed ex vivo to the wild-type S.

However, the properties of immune cells in these tumors has been vastly understudied compared with their adult counterparts. We combined multiplex immunofluorescence immunohistochemistry coupled with machine learning and single-cell mass cytometry to evaluate T-cells infiltrating pediatric glial tumors. We show that low-grade tumors are characterized by greater T-cell density compared with high-grade glioma (HGG). However, even among low-grade tumors, T-cell infiltration can be highly variable and subtype-dependent, with greater T-cell density in pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma and ganglioglioma. CD3+ T-cell infiltration correlates inversely with the expression of SOX2, an embryonal stem cell marker commonly expressed by glial tumors. T-cells within both HGG and low-grade glioma (LGG) exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity and tissue-resident memory T-cells consist of distinct subsets of CD103+ and TCF1+ cells that exhibit distinct spatial localization patterns. TCF1+ T-cells are located closer to the vessels while CD103+ resident T-cells reside within the tumor further away from the vasculature. Recurrent tumors are characterized by a decline in CD103+ tumor-infiltrating T-cells. BRAFV600E mutation is immunogenic in children with LGG and may serve as a target for immune therapy. These data provide several novel insights into the subtype-dependent and grade-dependent changes in immune architecture in pediatric gliomas and suggest that harnessing tumor-resident T-cells may be essential to improve immune control in glioma."

Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models mimic the pathophysiological environment of in vivo tumors and are rapidly emerging as a valuable research tool. Here, multimodal MSI techniques were employed to characterize a novel aggregated 3D lung adenocarcinoma model, developed by the group to mimic the in vivo tissue. Regions of tumor heterogeneity and the hypoxic microenvironment were observed based on the spatial distribution of a variety of endogenous molecules. Desorption electrospray ionization (DESI)-MSI defined regions of a hypoxic core and a proliferative outer layer from metabolite distribution. Targeted metabolites (e.g., lactate, glutamine, and citrate) were mapped to pathways of glycolysis and the TCA cycle demonstrating tumor metabolic behavior. The first application of imaging mass cytometry (IMC) with 3D cell culture enabled single-cell phenotyping at 1 μm spatial resolution. Protein markers of proliferation (Ki-67) and hypoxia (glucose transporter 1) defined metabolic signaling in the aggregoid model, which complemented the metabolite data. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma (LA-ICP)-MSI analysis localized endogenous elements including magnesium and copper, further differentiating the hypoxia gradient and validating the protein expression. Obtaining a large amount of molecular information on a complementary nature enabled an in-depth understanding of the biological processes within the novel tumor model. Combining powerful imaging techniques to characterize the aggregated 3D culture highlighted a future methodology with potential applications in cancer research and drug development."

However, a global and detailed characterization of the changes that human circulating immune cells undergo with age is lacking. Here, we combined scRNA-seq, mass cytometry and scATAC-seq to compare immune cell types in peripheral blood collected from young and old subjects and patients with COVID-19. We found that the immune cell landscape was reprogrammed with age and was characterized by T cell polarization from naive and memory cells to effector, cytotoxic, exhausted and regulatory cells, along with increased late natural killer cells, age-associated B cells, inflammatory monocytes and age-associated dendritic cells. In addition, the expression of genes, which were implicated in coronavirus susceptibility, was upregulated in a cell subtype-specific manner with age. Notably, COVID-19 promoted age-induced immune cell polarization and gene expression related to inflammation and cellular senescence. Therefore, these findings suggest that a dysregulated immune system and increased gene expression associated with SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility may at least partially account for COVID-19 vulnerability in the elderly."

Epub 2020 Aug 10.,Keywords: neuroinflammation; single cell.,"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), most prevalent in women, and with an important social and economic cost worldwide. It is triggered by self-reacting lymphocytes that infiltrate the CNS and initiate neuroinflammation. Further, axonal loss and neuronal death takes place, leading to neurodegeneration and brain atrophy. The murine model for studying MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), consists in immunizing mice with myelin-derived epitopes. APCs activate encephalitogenic T CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes that migrate mainly to the spinal cord resulting in neuroinflammation. Most of the knowledge on the pathophysiology and treatment of MS was obtained from EAE experiments, as Th17 cells, anti-alpha4 blocking Abs and the role of microbiota. Conversely, recent technology breakthroughs, such as CyTOF and single-cell RNA-seq, promise to revolutionize our understanding on the mechanisms involved both in MS and EAE. In fact, the importance of specific cellular populations and key molecules in MS/EAE is a constant matter of debate. It is well accepted that both Th1 and Th17 T CD4 lymphocytes play a relevant role in disease initiation after re-activation in situ. What is still under constant investigation, however, is the plasticity of the lymphocyte population, and the individual contribution of both resident and inflammatory cells for the progression or recovery of the disease. Thus, in this review, new findings obtained after single-cell analysis of blood and central nervous system infiltrating cells from MS/EAE and how they have contributed to a better knowledge on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of neuroinflammation are discussed."

Using a vaccine-challenge model in HLA-DR transgenic mice, we demonstrated significant alterations in circulating T-cell and innate immune populations that distinguished vaccinated from naïve mice within 10 days, and persisted until at least 35 days post-vaccination. Following challenge, vaccinated mice exhibited reduced bacterial burden and splenomegaly, along with distinct effector T-cell and monocyte profiles. Correlation of HDI data to serological and pathological measurements was performed. Our data indicate a Th1-biased response to Cb, consistent with previous reports, and identify Ly6C, CD73, and T-bet expression in T-cell, NK-cell, and monocytic populations as distinguishing features between vaccinated and naïve mice.

Manual basophil counting of peripheral blood smears is currently regarded as the reference method, although the limitations of this method (distribution, observer, and statistical errors) are widely recognized. Automated hematology analyzers offer an advantage of larger numbers of counted cells and high throughput but are characterized by inconsistent analytical performance for basophil enumeration. Flow cytometric enumeration of circulating basophils using panels of monoclonal antibodies is being developed as novel candidate reference method for the absolute basophil count in peripheral blood. Basophil counting using fluorescence flow cytometry is characterized by high precision and statistical superiority. Emerging innovative technologies for absolute cell counts include imaging flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and on-chip blood counting, but their analytical performance for absolute basophil counts is yet to be established.

Preprint.,Keywords: COVID-19; Machine learning; cancer immunology; human immune monitoring; mass cytometry; rhinovirus; single cell; spectral flow cytometry; systems immunology.,"For an emerging disease like COVID-19, systems immunology tools may quickly identify and quantitatively characterize cells associated with disease progression or clinical response. With repeated sampling, immune monitoring creates a real-time portrait of the cells reacting to a novel virus before disease specific knowledge and tools are established. However, single cell analysis tools can struggle to reveal rare cells that are under 0.1% of the population. Here, the machine learning workflow Tracking Responders Expanding (T-REX) was created to identify changes in both very rare and common cells in diverse human immune monitoring settings. T-REX identified cells that were highly similar in phenotype and localized to hotspots of significant change during rhinovirus and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Specialized reagents used to detect the rhinovirus-specific CD4+ cells, MHCII tetramers, were not used during unsupervised analysis and instead 'left out' to serve as a test of whether T-REX identified biologically significant cells. In the rhinovirus challenge study, T-REX identified virus-specific CD4+ T cells based on these cells being a distinct phenotype that expanded by ≥95% following infection. T-REX successfully identified hotspots containing virus-specific T cells using pairs of samples comparing Day 7 of infection to samples taken either prior to infection (Day 0) or after clearing the infection (Day 28). Mapping pairwise comparisons in samples according to both the direction and degree of change provided a framework to compare systems level immune changes during infectious disease or therapy response. This revealed that the magnitude and direction of systemic immune change in some COVID-19 patients was comparable to that of blast crisis acute myeloid leukemia patients undergoing induction chemotherapy and characterized the identity of the immune cells that changed the most. Other COVID-19 patients instead matched an immune trajectory like that of individuals with rhinovirus infection or melanoma patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy. T-REX analysis of paired blood samples provides an approach to rapidly identify and characterize mechanistically significant cells and to place emerging diseases into a systems immunology context."

As such, it allows us to gain spatial information and antigen quantification in situ, and can be applied to both snap-frozen and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. Herein, we have developed and optimized the immunodetection conditions for a 34-antibody panel for use on human snap-frozen tissue sections. For this, we tested the performance of 80 antibodies. Moreover, we compared tissue drying times, fixation procedures and antibody incubation conditions. We observed that variations in the drying times of tissue sections had little impact on the quality of the images. Fixation with methanol for 5 min at -20°C or 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 5 min at room temperature followed by methanol for 5 min at -20°C were superior to fixation with acetone or PFA only. Finally, we observed that antibody incubation overnight at 4°C yielded more consistent results as compared to staining at room temperature for 5 h. Finally, we used the optimized method for staining of human fetal and adult intestinal tissue samples. We present the tissue architecture and spatial distribution of the stromal cells and immune cells in these samples visualizing blood vessels, the epithelium and lamina propria based on the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), E-Cadherin and Vimentin, while simultaneously revealing the colocalization of T cells, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), and various myeloid cell subsets in the lamina propria of the human fetal intestine.

Finally, antigen stimulation of human whole blood, analyzed by a previously unreported mass cytometry assay, indicated broader immunogenicity of gdPT compared to pertussis toxoid. These findings establish a direct link between the conserved structure of gdPT and its ability to generate a robust immune response."

We reveal extensive heterogeneity in CD8+ T-cell composition, including expanded effector and post-effector terminally differentiated CD8+ T cells. While UC-associated CD8+ effector T cells can trigger tissue destruction and produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, post-effector cells acquire innate signatures to adopt regulatory functions that may mitigate excessive inflammation. Thus, we identify colonic CD8+ T-cell phenotypes in health and UC, define their clonal relationships and characterize terminally differentiated dysfunctional UC CD8+ T cells expressing IL-26, which attenuate acute colitis in a humanized IL-26 transgenic mouse model."

Based on the expression of signature cytokines and transcription factors, several Th subsets have been defined. Th cells are thought to be far more heterogeneous and multifunctional than originally believed, but characterization of the full diversity has been hindered by technical limitations. Here, we employ mass cytometry to analyze the diversity of Th cell responses generated in vitro and in animal disease models, revealing a vast heterogeneity of effector states with distinct cytokine footprints. The diversities of cytokine responses established during primary antigen encounters in Th1- and Th2-cell-polarizing conditions are largely maintained after secondary challenge, regardless of the new inflammatory environment, highlighting many of the identified states as stable Th cell sublineages. We also find that Th17 cells tend to upregulate Th2-cell-associated cytokines upon challenge, indicating a closer developmental connection between Th17 and Th2 cells than previously anticipated."

Loss of IRF8 exerts a differential effect on DC subsets, including plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and the classical DC lineages cDC1 and cDC2. In humans, cDC2-related subsets have been described including AXL+SIGLEC6+ pre-DC, DC2 and DC3. The origin of this heterogeneity is unknown. Using high-dimensional analysis, in vitro differentiation, and an allelic series of human IRF8 deficiency, we demonstrated that cDC2 (CD1c+DC) heterogeneity originates from two distinct pathways of development. The lymphoid-primed IRF8hi pathway, marked by CD123 and BTLA, carried pDC, cDC1, and DC2 trajectories, while the common myeloid IRF8lo pathway, expressing SIRPA, formed DC3s and monocytes. We traced distinct trajectories through the granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP) compartment showing that AXL+SIGLEC6+ pre-DCs mapped exclusively to the DC2 pathway. In keeping with their lower requirement for IRF8, DC3s expand to replace DC2s in human partial IRF8 deficiency."

It is particularly intriguing to observe that despite the numerous new avenues of immune-related mechanisms, such as cancer immunotherapy, the proportion of immunology manuscripts related to autoimmunity continues to increase and has been approaching 20% in 2019. As in the previous 13 years, we performed an arbitrary selection of the peer-reviewed articles published by the major dedicated Journals and discussed the common themes which continue to outnumber peculiarites in autoimmune diseases. The investigated areas included systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), autoantibodies (autoAbs), and common therapeutic avenues and novel pathogenic mechanisms for autoimmune conditions. Some examples include new pathogenetic evidence which is well represented by IL21 or P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) in SLE or the application of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), mass cytometry, bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and flow cytometry for the analysis of different cellular populations in RA. Cumulatively and of interest to the clinicians, a large number of findings continue to underline the importance of a strict relationship between basic and clinical science to define new pathogenetic and therapeutic developments. The therapeutic pipeline in autoimmunity continues to grow and maintain a constant flow of new molecules, as well illustrated in RA and PsA, and this is most certainly derived from the new basic evidence and the high-throughput tools applied to autoimmune diseases."

CyTOF was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from PBC patients (n = 33) and age-/sex-matched healthy controls (n = 33) to obtain immune cell abundance and marker expression profiles. Hierarchical clustering methods were applied to identify immune cell types and subsets significantly associated with PBC. Subsets of gamma-delta T cells (CD3+TCRgd+), CD8+ T cells (CD3+CD8+CD161+PD1+), and memory B cells (CD3-CD19+CD20+CD24+CD27+) were found to have lower abundance in PBC than in control. In contrast, higher abundance of subsets of monocytes and naïve B cells were observed in PBC compared to control. Furthermore, several naïve B cell (CD3-CD19+CD20+CD24-CD27-) subsets were significantly higher in PBC patients with cirrhosis (indicative of late-stage disease) than in those without cirrhosis. Alternatively, subsets of memory B cells were lower in abundance in cirrhotic relative to non-cirrhotic PBC patients.

Here we report the results of a randomized controlled trial (NCT02542592) in which we employ a high-dimensional mass cytometry approach to characterize innate and adaptive cell signaling dynamics after a major surgery (primary outcome) in patients treated with placebo or methylprednisolone (MP). A robust, unsupervised bootstrap clustering of immune cell subsets coupled with random forest analysis shows profound (AUC = 0.92, p-value = 3.16E-8) MP-induced alterations of immune cell signaling trajectories, particularly in the adaptive compartments. By contrast, key innate signaling responses previously associated with pain and functional recovery after surgery, including STAT3 and CREB phosphorylation, are not affected by MP. These results imply cell-specific and pathway-specific effects of GCs, and also prompt future studies to examine GCs' effects on clinical outcomes likely dependent on functional adaptive immune responses."

Although monocytes are often seen as simple precursor cells, they also function as independent immune effector cells. In this review, we summarize these monocyte-specific functions during cryptococcal infection and the influence of C. neoformans on monocyte responses. We also cover the most recent findings on the functional and phenotypic heterogeneity of monocytes and discuss how new advanced technologies provide a platform to address outstanding questions in the field."

We conducted a phase 1 study with the combination of sorafenib (a FLT3-ITD inhibitor), plerixafor (a SDF-1/CXCR4 inhibitor), and G-CSF (that cleaves SDF-1, CD44, and VLA4). Twenty-eight patients with relapsed/refractory FLT3-ITD-mutated AML were enrolled from December 2010 to December 2013 at three dose levels of sorafenib (400, 600, and 800 mg twice daily) and G-CSF and plerixafor were administered every other day for seven doses starting on day one. Sorafenib 800 mg twice daily was selected for the expansion phase. While no dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) were encountered in the four-week DLT window, hand-foot syndrome and rash were seen beyond the DLT window, which required dose reductions in most patients. The response rate was 36% (complete response (CR) = 4, complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) = 4, complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) = 1, and partial response (PR) = 1) for the intention to treat population. Treatment resulted in 58.4 and 47 mean fold mobilization of blasts and CD34 /38- stem/progenitor cells, respectively, to the circulation. Expression of the adhesion molecules CXCR4, CD44, and VLA4 on circulating leukemia cells correlated negatively with the mobilization of CD34+/38-, CD34+/38-/123+ ""progenitor"" cells (all P ≤ .002). Mass cytometry analysis of sequential samples from two patients demonstrated resistance emerging early on from sub-clones with persistent Akt and/or ERK signaling.

Whether properties of the host immune response impact disease risk and outcome is not known. Here, we combine mass cytometry, single cell genomics, and functional studies to characterize the BM immune environment in children with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myelogenous leukemia at presentation. T cells in leukemia marrow demonstrate evidence of chronic immune activation and exhaustion/dysfunction, with attrition of naive T cells and TCF1+ stem-like memory T cells and accumulation of terminally differentiated effector T cells. Marrow-infiltrating NK cells also exhibit evidence of dysfunction, particularly in myeloid leukemia. Properties of immune cells identified distinct immune phenotype-based clusters correlating with disease risk in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. High-risk immune signatures were associated with expression of stem-like genes on tumor cells. These data provide a comprehensive assessment of the immune landscape of childhood leukemias and identify targets potentially amenable to therapeutic intervention. These studies also suggest that properties of the host response with depletion of naive T cells and accumulation of terminal-effector T cells may contribute to the biologic basis of disease risk. Properties of immune microenvironment identified here may also impact optimal application of immune therapies, including T cell-redirection approaches in childhood leukemia."

An important feature of this rare case included the strategy to validate the pathogenicity of a variant of the IL2RG gene when the T and B cell lineages comprised only revertant cells. We studied the X-inactivation of sorted T cells from the mother to show that the pathogenic variant was indeed the cause of his SCID. One interesting feature was a progressive loss of B cells over 20 years. CyTOF (cytometry time of flight) analysis of bone marrow offered a potential explanation of the B cell failure, with expansions of progenitor populations that suggest a developmental block. Another interesting feature was that the patient bore extensive granulomatous disease and skin cancers that contained T cells, despite severe T cell lymphopenia in the blood. Finally, the patient had a few hundred T cells on presentation but his TCRs comprised a very limited repertoire, supporting the important conclusion that repertoire size trumps numbers of T cells."

While the characteristic clinical features are becoming clear, the pathophysiology remains unknown. Herein, we report on the immune profiles of eight Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) cases. We document that all MIS-C patients had evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure, mounting an antibody response with normal isotype-switching and neutralization capability. We further profiled the secreted immune response by high-dimensional cytokine assays, which identified elevated signatures of inflammation (IL-18 and IL-6), lymphocytic and myeloid chemotaxis and activation (CCL3, CCL4, and CDCP1) and mucosal immune dysregulation (IL-17A, CCL20, CCL28). Mass cytometry immunophenotyping of peripheral blood revealed reductions of mDC1 and non-classical monocytes, as well as both NK- and T- lymphocytes, suggesting extravasation to affected tissues. Markers of activated myeloid function were also evident, including upregulation of ICAM1 and FcR1 in neutrophil and non-classical monocytes, well-documented markers in autoinflammation and autoimmunity that indicate enhanced antigen presentation and Fc-mediated responses. Finally, to assess the role for autoimmunity secondary to infection, we profiled the auto-antigen reactivity of MIS-C plasma, which revealed both known disease-associated autoantibodies (anti-La) and novel candidates that recognize endothelial, gastrointestinal and immune-cell antigens. All patients were treated with anti- IL6R antibody or IVIG, which led to rapid disease resolution tracking with normalization of inflammatory markers."

While most studies have determined virus-host cell interactions using cultured cells in bulk, recent advances in deep protein profiling from single cells enable the understanding of the dynamic response equilibrium of single cells even within the same cell types. Mass cytometry allows the simultaneous detection of multiple proteins in single cells, which helps to evaluate alterations in multiple signaling networks that work in tandem in deciding the response of a cell to the presence of a pathogen or other stimulus. In applying this technique to studying varicella zoster virus (VZV), it was possible to better understand the molecular basis for lymphotropism of the virus and how virus-induced effects on T cells promoted skin tropism. While the ability of VZV to manifest itself in the skin is well established, how the virus is transported to the skin and causes the characteristic VZV skin lesions was not well elucidated. Through mass cytometry analysis of VZV-infected tonsil T cells, we were able to observe that VZV unleashes a ""remodeling"" program in the infected T cells that not only makes these T cells more skin tropic but also at the same time induces changes that make these T cells unlikely to respond to immune stimulation during the journey to the skin."

Epub 2020 Jul 16.,Keywords: T lymphocytes; atherosclerosis; interferons; macrophages; monocytes; mouse; neutrophils.,"The diverse leukocyte infiltrate in atherosclerotic mouse aortas was recently analyzed in 9 single-cell RNA sequencing and 2 mass cytometry studies. In a comprehensive meta-analysis, we confirm 4 known macrophage subsets-resident, inflammatory, interferon-inducible cell, and Trem2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2) foamy macrophages-and identify a new macrophage subset resembling cavity macrophages. We also find that monocytes, neutrophils, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, innate lymphoid cells-2, and CD (cluster of differentiation)-8 T cells form prominent and separate immune cell populations in atherosclerotic aortas. Many CD4 T cells express IL (interleukin)-17 and the chemokine receptor CXCR (C-X-C chemokine receptor)-6. A small number of regulatory T cells and T helper 1 cells is also identified. Immature and naive T cells are present in both healthy and atherosclerotic aortas. Our meta-analysis overcomes limitations of individual studies that, because of their experimental approach, over- or underrepresent certain cell populations. Mass cytometry studies demonstrate that cell surface phenotype provides valuable information beyond the cell transcriptomes. The present analysis helps resolve some long-standing controversies in the field. First, Trem2+ foamy macrophages are not proinflammatory but interferon-inducible cell and inflammatory macrophages are. Second, about half of all foam cells are smooth muscle cell-derived, retaining smooth muscle cell transcripts rather than transdifferentiating to macrophages. Third, Pf4, which had been considered specific for platelets and megakaryocytes, is also prominently expressed in the main population of resident vascular macrophages. Fourth, a new type of resident macrophage shares transcripts with cavity macrophages. Finally, the discovery of a prominent innate lymphoid cell-2 cluster links the single-cell RNA sequencing work to recent flow cytometry data suggesting a strong atheroprotective role of innate lymphoid cells-2. This resolves apparent discrepancies regarding the role of T helper 2 cells in atherosclerosis based on studies that predated the discovery of innate lymphoid cells-2 cells."

Monocyte and interstitial macrophages that express the C-C motif CCR2 (chemokine receptor 2) are active in IPF and central to fibrosis.Objectives: To phenotype patients with IPF for potential targeted therapy, we developed 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i, a radiotracer to noninvasively track CCR2+ monocytes and macrophages using positron emission tomography (PET).Methods: CCR2+ cells were investigated in mice with bleomycin- or radiation-induced fibrosis and in human subjects with IPF. The CCR2+ cell populations were localized relative to fibrotic regions in lung tissue and characterized using immunolocalization, single-cell mass cytometry, and Ccr2 RNA in situ hybridization and then correlated with parallel quantitation of lung uptake by 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i PET.Measurements and Main Results: Mouse models established that increased 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i PET uptake in the lung correlates with CCR2+ cell infiltration associated with fibrosis (n = 72). As therapeutic models, the inhibition of fibrosis by IL-1β blockade (n = 19) or antifibrotic pirfenidone (n = 18) reduced CCR2+ macrophage accumulation and uptake of the radiotracer in mouse lungs. In lung tissues from patients with IPF, CCR2+ cells concentrated in perifibrotic regions and correlated with radiotracer localization (n = 21). Human imaging revealed little lung uptake in healthy volunteers (n = 7), whereas subjects with IPF (n = 4) exhibited intensive signals in fibrotic zones.Conclusions: These findings support a role for imaging CCR2+ cells within the fibrogenic niche in IPF to provide a molecular target for personalized therapy and monitoring.Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03492762)."

Here, a single-cell study involving 17 432 600 immune cells of 39 matched HCC (T), nontumor (N), and leading-edge (L) specimens by mass cytometry is conducted. The tumor-associated CD4/CD8 double-positive T (DPT) cells are found enriched in L regions with synergetic expression of PD-1/HLA-DR/ICOS/CD45RO and exhibit a higher level of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and PD-1 upon stimulation. The enrichment of DPT and PD-1+DPT in L regions indicates favorable prognosis. These tumor-associated DPT cells with similar phenotype are also verified in other tumors and HCC animal models. Single-cell RNA-seq further characterizes the molecular features of DPT cells and uncovers 11 clusters with different cytotoxicity, exhaustion, and activation scores. TCR-based trajectory analysis reveals that tumor-associated DPT clusters share separated ancestries with local CD4+ or CD8+SPT cells rather than CD3+PBMC cells. TCR clones with frequency above 10 are mainly found coexisting in DPT and CD8+SPT cells. Specifically, PD-1highDPT cluster (TDPT_10) shares the same ancestry with exhausted CD8+SPT cluster (TCD8T_2) and shows higher expression similarity and closer pathological location to PD-1+CD8+ than PD-1+CD4+T cells. Together, this study systematically characterizes the unique distribution of PD-1+DPTs in HCC and puts forward new insights for the function and origin of tumor-associated DPT cells."

Yet, while immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) revealed that T lymphocytes play a major role in lung cancer, the precise dynamic of innate and adaptive immune cells induced by anticancer treatments including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and/or ICB is poorly understood. In lung cancer, studies evaluating specific immune cell populations as predictors of response to medical treatment are scarce, and knowledge is fragmented. Here, we review the different techniques allowing the detection of immune cells in the tumor and blood (multiplex immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, RNA-seq, DNA methylation pattern, mass cytometry, functional tests). In addition, we present data that consider different baseline immune cell populations as predictors of response to medical treatments of lung cancer. We also review the potential for assessing dynamic changes in cell populations during treatment as a biomarker. As powerful tools for immune cell detection and data analysis are available, clinicians and researchers could increase understanding of mechanisms of efficacy and resistance in addition to identifying new targets for IO by developing translational studies that decipher the role of different immune cell populations during lung cancer treatments."

To address limitations of sensitivity and mass-channel capacity, a nanobarcoding platform is developed for multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) using secondary ion beam spectrometry that utilizes fabricated isotopically encoded nanotags. Use of combinatorial isotope distributions in 100 nm sized nanotags expands the labeling palette to overcome the spectral bounds of mass channels. As a proof-of-principle, a four-digit (i.e., 0001-1111) barcoding scheme is demonstrated to detect 16 variants of 2H, 19F, 79/81Br, and 127I elemental barcode sets that are encoded in silica nanoparticle matrices. A computational debarcoding method and an automated machine learning analysis approach are developed to extract barcodes for accurate quantification of spatial nanotag distributions in large ion beam imaging areas up to 0.6 mm2.

Purpose To develop molecular MRI tools to reveal resistance mechanisms to immuno-oncologic therapies caused by the immuno-metabolic interplay in a translational liver cancer model. Materials and Methods A total of 21 VX2 liver tumor-bearing New Zealand white rabbits were used between October 2018 and February 2020. Rabbits were divided into three groups. Group A (n = 3) underwent intra-arterial infusion of gadolinium 160 (160Gd)-labeled anti-human leukocyte antigen-DR isotope (HLA-DR) antibodies to detect antigen-presenting immune cells. Group B (n = 3) received rhodamine-conjugated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) intravenously to detect macrophages. These six rabbits underwent 3-T MRI, including T1- and T2-weighted imaging, before and 24 hours after contrast material administration. Group C (n = 15) underwent extracellular pH mapping with use of MR spectroscopy. Of those 15 rabbits, six underwent conventional transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), four underwent conventional TACE with extracellular pH-buffering bicarbonate, and five served as untreated controls. MRI signal intensity distribution was validated by using immunohistochemistry staining of HLA-DR and CD11b, Prussian blue iron staining, fluorescence microscopy of rhodamine, and imaging mass cytometry (IMC) of gadolinium. Statistical analysis included Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results T1-weighted MRI with 160Gd-labeled antibodies revealed localized peritumoral ring enhancement, which corresponded to gadolinium distribution detected with IMC. T2-weighted MRI with SPIONs showed curvilinear signal intensity representing selective peritumoral deposition in macrophages. Extracellular pH-specific MR spectroscopy of untreated liver tumors showed acidosis (mean extracellular pH, 6.78 ± 0.09) compared with liver parenchyma (mean extracellular pH, 7.18 ± 0.03) (P = .008) and peritumoral immune cell exclusion. Normalization of tumor extracellular pH (mean, 6.96 ± 0.05; P = .02) using bicarbonate during TACE increased peri- and intratumoral immune cell infiltration (P = .002). Conclusion MRI in a rabbit liver tumor model was used to visualize resistance mechanisms mediated by the immuno-metabolic interplay that inform susceptibility and response to immuno-oncologic therapies, providing a therapeutic strategy to restore immune permissiveness in liver cancer. © RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article."

IL-7Rα had diverse, but organized, expressional relationship in EM CD8+ T cells with molecules related to cell function and gene regulation, which rendered an immune landscape defining heterogeneous cell subsets. The differential expression of these molecules likely has biological implications as we found in vivo signatures of transcription factors and homeostasis cytokine receptors, including T-bet and IL-7Rα.

Several types of immunotherapy, including adoptive cell transfer (ACT) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), have obtained durable clinical responses, but their efficacies vary, and only subsets of cancer patients can benefit from them. Immune infiltrates in the tumor microenvironment (TME) have been shown to play a key role in tumor development and will affect the clinical outcomes of cancer patients. Comprehensive profiling of tumor-infiltrating immune cells would shed light on the mechanisms of cancer-immune evasion, thus providing opportunities for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. However, the highly heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the TME impedes the precise dissection of intratumoral immune cells. With recent advances in single-cell technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and mass cytometry, systematic interrogation of the TME is feasible and will provide insights into the functional diversities of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. In this review, we outline the recent progress in cancer immunotherapy, particularly by focusing on landmark studies and the recent single-cell characterization of tumor-associated immune cells, and we summarize the phenotypic diversities of intratumoral immune cells and their connections with cancer immunotherapy. We believe such a review could strengthen our understanding of the progress in cancer immunotherapy, facilitate the elucidation of immune cell modulation in tumor progression, and thus guide the development of novel immunotherapies for cancer treatment."

But due to the many fundamental functions of the liver notably linked to detoxication, metabolism, protein synthesis, or immunology, Kupffer cells are exposed to a dynamic environment and constantly adapt themselves by modulating their gene and protein expressions. In this context, the characterization of these cells at steady-state and upon challenges may be limited by the classical microscopy or flow cytometry which allow for the use of only few selected markers. On the other end, transcriptomic approach, although being very powerful, can be costly and time-consuming. So mass cytometry offers a good compromise, allowing for the monitoring of a representative set of markers (up to 40) in a simple experiment.

Furthermore, differences in cell isolation and enrichment protocols, antibody reagent preparation, sample staining and data acquisition protocols can all introduce technical variation that can potentially confound integrative analyses of large data-sets of samples processed across multiple labs. Here, we present a streamlined whole blood CyTOF workflow which addresses many of these sources of experimental variation and facilitates wider adoption of CyTOF immune monitoring across sites with limited technical expertise or sample-processing resources or equipment. Our workflow utilizes commercially available reagents including the Fluidigm MaxPar Direct Immune Profiling Assay (MDIPA), a dry tube 30-marker immunophenotyping panel, and SmartTube Proteomic Stabilizer, which allows for simple and reliable fixation and cryopreservation of whole blood samples. We validate a workflow that allows for streamlined staining of whole blood samples with minimal processing requirements or expertise at the site of sample collection, followed by shipment to a central CyTOF core facility for batched downstream processing and data acquisition. We further demonstrate the application of this workflow to characterize immune responses in a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, highlighting key disease-associated changes in immune cell frequency and phenotype."

It is therefore of immense importance to identify biomarkers predicting clinical responses to treatment and patient survival, which would not only assist in targeting treatments to patients most likely to benefit, but might also provide mechanistic insights into the reasons for success or failure of the therapy. Several peripheral blood or tumor tissue diagnostic and predictive biomarkers known to be informative for cancer patient survival may be applicable for this purpose. The use of peripheral blood (""liquid biopsy"") offers numerous advantages not only for predicting treatment responses at baseline but also for monitoring patients on-therapy. Assessment of the tumor microenvironment and infiltrating immune cells also delivers important information on cancer-host interactions but the requirement for tumor tissues makes this more challenging, especially for monitoring sequential changes in the individual patient. In this contribution, we will review our findings on immune signatures potentially informative for clinical outcome in melanoma, breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma, particularly the outcome of checkpoint blockade, by applying multiparametric flow cytometry and mass cytometry, routine clinical monitoring and functional testing for predicting and following individual patient responses to therapy."

Breast milk has a clear protective effect against both these outcomes likely due to multiple mechanisms which are not fully understood but may involve effects on both the infant's immune system and the developing gut microbiota. Congregating at the interface between the mucosal barrier and the microbiota, innate and adaptive T lymphocytes (T cells) participate in this interaction but few studies have explored their development after preterm delivery. We conducted a literature review of T cell development that focuses on fetal development, postnatal maturation and the influence of milk diet. The majority of circulating T cells in the preterm infant display a naïve phenotype but are still able to initiate functional responses similar to those seen in term infants. T cells from preterm infants display a skew toward a T-helper 2(Th2) phenotype and have an increased population of regulatory cells (Tregs). There are significant gaps in knowledge in this area, particularly in regards to innate-like T cells, but work is emerging: transcriptomics and mass cytometry are currently being used to map out T cell development, whilst microbiomic approaches may help improve understanding of events at mucosal surfaces. A rapid rise in organoid models will allow robust exploration of host-microbe interactions and may support the development of interventions that modulate T-cell responses for improved infant health."

SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells were exclusively Th1 cells, and predominantly Tcm with phenotypic features of robust helper function.

Tracking the biological fate of exosomes in vivo is essential for evaluating their functions, delivery efficacy, and biosafety, and it is invaluable for guiding exosome-based therapy. Here, we merged a single-cell technique, mass cytometry, with in vivo uptake analysis to comprehensively reveal the fate of exosomes at the single-cell level. In tandem with multivariate cellular phenotyping, in vivo uptake of exosomes labeled with heavy metal-containing tags was quantified in a high-throughput manner. Interestingly, an organ-dependent uptake landscape of exosomes by diverse cell types was distinctly demonstrated, which implied that cancer cells seemed to preferably take up more released drugs from the exosomes. Using these cellular insights, the administration method of drug-loaded exosomes was optimized to elevate their accumulation in tumor sites and minimize their spread into healthy organs. Dual drug-loaded exosomes were locally administered and superior synergistic tumor treatment effects were achieved in a solid tumor model. The disclosure of exosome cellular distribution, together with the successful engineering of exosomes with multiple anticancer capacities, provides a new level of insight into optimizing and enhancing exosome-based drug delivery and synergistic tumor therapy."

We introduce a machine learning algorithm, Risk Assessment Population IDentification (RAPID), that is unsupervised and automated, identifies phenotypically distinct cell populations, and determines whether these populations stratify patient survival. With a pilot mass cytometry dataset of 2 million cells from 28 glioblastomas, RAPID identified tumor cells whose abundance independently and continuously stratified patient survival. Statistical validation within the workflow included repeated runs of stochastic steps and cell subsampling. Biological validation used an orthogonal platform, immunohistochemistry, and a larger cohort of 73 glioblastoma patients to confirm the findings from the pilot cohort. RAPID was also validated to find known risk stratifying cells and features using published data from blood cancer. Thus, RAPID provides an automated, unsupervised approach for finding statistically and biologically significant cells using cytometry data from patient samples."

High quality imaging mass cytometry trials, based on 115In detection were performed to highlight the behavior of the material. Anti-CD20 antibody was labeled by the so-obtained In(III)-modified polylysine using the biotin/neutravidin interaction.

Both immunofluorescence microscopy (IF-M) and mass cytometry analyses confirmed the specific binding of anti-CD20 onto Ramos cells. CyTOF histograms constructed on the 115In detection allowed us to define and to separate, with a good signal-to-noise ratio, two populations (Ramos and HL-60). The inertness of In(III)-MCP-NAv over a three-month storage period was proved by performing new functionality tests involving Jurkat cells (CD20[-]) and multiparametric trials involving the 115In channel.

Still, there is rationale and evidence supporting immune therapy in OC. We investigated the potential for adoptive cell therapy (ACT) from in vitro expanded tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in combination with checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and conducted immunological testing of ex vivo expanded TILs (REP-TILs). Six patients with late-stage metastatic high-grade serous OC were treated with immune therapy consisting of ipilimumab followed by surgery to obtain TILs and infusion of REP-TILs, low-dose IL-2 and nivolumab. One patient achieved a partial response and 5 others experienced disease stabilization for up to 12 months. Analysis of the REP-TILs with flow- and mass-cytometry show primarily activated and differentiated effector memory T cells. REP-TILs showed in vitro reactivity and expression of inhibitory receptors, such as LAG-3 and PD-1. Furthermore, our data indicate that addition of ipilimumab therapy improves the T cell fold expansion during production, increase the level of CD8 T cell tumor reactivity, and favorably affect the T cell phenotype. We show that the combination of ICI and ACT is feasible and safe. With one partial response and one long-lasting SD, we demonstrated the potential of ACT in OC."

The development of targeted therapies is complicated by heterogeneous clinical manifestations, varying organ involvement, and toxicity. Despite advances in understanding the mechanisms contributing to SLE, only one biologic drug, belimumab, is FDA-approved. The identification and development of potential therapies have largely been driven by studies in lupus animal models. Therefore, direct comparison of both the therapeutic and immunological findings in human and murine SLE studies is critical and can reveal important insights into indeed how useful and relevant are murine studies in SLE drug development. Studies involving belimumab, mycophenolate mofetil, abatacept, rituximab, and anti-interferon strategies generally demonstrated analogous findings in the attenuation of SLE manifestations and modulation of select immune cell populations in human and murine SLE. While further basic and translational studies are needed to identify SLE patient subsets likely to respond to particular therapeutic modalities and in dissecting complex mechanisms, we believe that despite some inherent weaknesses SLE mouse models will continue to be integral in developing targeted SLE therapies."

Here, we used a mouse burn trauma model to screen for memory-like T cell responses to injury by transferring T cells from sham or burn CD45.1 mice into CD45.2 mice and performing secondary injuries in recipient mice. Among all T cell subsets that were measured, only Tregs expanded in response to secondary injury. The expanded Tregs were a CD44high /CD62Llow subpopulation, markers indicative of memory T cells. CyTOF (cytometry by time-of-flight) mass cytometry was used to demonstrate that injury-expanded Tregs expressed higher levels of CD44, CTLA-4, ICOS, GITR, and Helios than Tregs from noninjured mice. Next, we tested whether a similar population of Tregs might react acutely to burn trauma. We observed that Tregs with a phenotype that matched the injury-expanded Tregs were activated by 6 h after injury. To test if Treg activation by trauma requires functional MHC class II, we measured trauma-induced Treg activation in MHC class II gene deficient (MHCII-/- ) mice or in mice that were given Fab fragment of anti-MHC class II antibody to block TCR activation. Injury-induced Treg activation occurred in normal mice but only partial activation was detected in MHCII-/- mice or in mice that were given Fab anti-MHCII antibody. These findings demonstrate that trauma activates a memory-like Treg subpopulation and that Treg activation by injury is partially dependent on TCR signaling by an MHC class II dependent mechanism."

Prior studies have illustrated many of the effects of IA inflammation on the uterine lining (decidua) and membranous layers of the placenta at the fetal-maternal interface. However, much less is known about the immunological response occurring within the villous placenta. Using a rhesus macaque model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IA inflammation, we showed that pregnancy-matched choriodecidua and villi have distinct immunological profiles in rhesus pregnancies. In the choriodecidua, we show that the abundance of neutrophils, multiple populations of antigen-presenting cells, and two populations of natural killer (NK) cells changes with prenatal IA LPS exposure. In contrast, in immune cells within the villous placenta we observed alterations in the abundance of B cells, monocytes, and CD8 T cells. Prior work has illustrated that IA inflammation leads to an increase in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) at the fetal-maternal interface. In this study, pretreatment with a TNFα blockade partially reversed inflammation in the placental villi. Furthermore, we report that immune cells in the villous placenta sensed LPS during our experimental window, and subsequently activated T cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, this study is the first report of memory T cells in third-trimester non-human primate placental villi and provides evidence that manipulation of immune cells in the villi at the fetal-maternal interface should be considered as a potential therapeutic target for IA inflammation."

The count of T cells, B cells, and NK cells was remarkably decreased in critical patients compared to normal controls. The percentage of CD8+ T cells was significantly lower in critical patients than that in common and severe patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The expression of IL-2R, JAK1, and STAT5 decreased in PBMC of common, severe, and critical patients, but IL-2 level was elevated in severe patients and decreased in critical patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The decrease of CD8+ T cells in critical patients with COVID-19 pneumonia may be related to the IL-2 signaling pathway.

As such, we sought to identify changes in NK cell phenotype and function using high-dimensional mass cytometry to simultaneously analyze both surface and functional marker expression of peripheral blood NK cells in a cohort of ART-suppressed, HIV+ patients and HIV- healthy controls. We found that the NK cell repertoire following IL-2 treatment was altered in individuals with treated HIV infection compared to healthy controls, with increased expression of markers including NKG2C and CD2, and decreased expression of CD244 and NKp30. Using co-culture assays with autologous, in vitro HIV-infected CD4 T cells, we identified a subset of NK cells with enhanced responsiveness to HIV-1-infected cells, but no differences in the magnitude of anti-HIV NK cell responses between the HIV+ and HIV- groups. In addition, by profiling of NK cell receptors on responding cells, we found similar phenotypes of HIV-responsive NK cell subsets in both groups. Lastly, we identified clusters of NK cells that are altered in individuals with treated HIV infection compared to healthy controls, but found that these clusters are distinct from those that respond to HIV in vitro. As such, we conclude that while chronic, treated HIV infection induces a reshaping of the IL-2-stimulated peripheral blood NK cell repertoire, it does so in a way that does not make the repertoire more HIV-specific."

A highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) influences brain tumor outgrowth. Whether the TME is predominantly shaped by the CNS micromilieu or by the malignancy itself is unknown, as is the diversity, origin, and function of CNS tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Here, we have mapped the leukocyte landscape of brain tumors using high-dimensional single-cell profiling (CyTOF). The heterogeneous composition of tissue-resident and invading immune cells within the TME alone permitted a clear distinction between gliomas and brain metastases (BrM). The glioma TME presented predominantly with tissue-resident, reactive microglia, whereas tissue-invading leukocytes accumulated in BrM. Tissue-invading TAMs showed a distinctive signature trajectory, revealing tumor-driven instruction along with contrasting lymphocyte activation and exhaustion. Defining the specific immunological signature of brain tumors can facilitate the rational design of targeted immunotherapy strategies."

The origin and heterogeneity of tissue-resident monocytes and macrophages in ovaries remains unknown. Here we identify three tissue-resident monocyte populations and five macrophage populations in the adult ovaries using high-dimensional single cell mass cytometry. Ontogenic analyses using cell fate mapping models and cell depletion experiments revealed the infiltration of ovaries by both yolk sac and fetal liver-derived macrophages already during the embryonic development. Moreover, we found that both embryonic and bone marrow-derived macrophages contribute to the distinct ovarian macrophage subpopulations in the adults. These assays also showed that fetal-derived MHC II-negative macrophages differentiate postnatally in the maturing ovary to MHC II-positive cells. Our analyses further unraveled that the developmentally distinct macrophage types share overlapping distribution and scavenging function in the ovaries under homeostatic conditions. In conclusion, we report here the first comprehensive analyses of ovarian monocytes and macrophages. In addition, we show that the mechanisms controlling monocyte immigration, the phenotype of different pools of interstitial macrophages, and the interconversion capacity of fetal-derived macrophages in ovaries are remarkably different from those seen in other tissue niches."

A comprehensive understanding of the intricate milieu and its interactions remains unclear, and single-cell analysis is crucially needed. Leveraging mass cytometry (CyTOF), we analyzed immunocytes from 13 initial and three recurrent GBM samples and their matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pPBMCs). Using a panel of 30 markers, we provide a high-dimensional view of the complex GBM immune microenvironment. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and polychromatic immunofluorescence were used for verification of the key findings. In the initial and recurrent GBMs, glioma-associated microglia/macrophages (GAMs) constituted 59.05 and 27.87% of the immunocytes, respectively; programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3), lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) demonstrated different expression levels in the GAMs among the patients. GAMs could be subdivided into different subgroups with different phenotypes. Both the exhausted T cell and regulatory T (Treg) cell percentages were significantly higher in tumors than in pPBMCs. The natural killer (NK) cells that infiltrated into the tumor lesions expressed higher levels of CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3), as these cells expressed lower levels of interferon-γ (IFNγ). The immune microenvironment in the initial and recurrent GBMs displayed similar suppressive changes. Our study confirmed that GAMs, as the dominant infiltrating immunocytes, present great inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity and that GAMs, increased exhausted T cells, infiltrating Tregs, and nonfunctional NK cells contribute to local immune suppressive characteristics. Recurrent GBMs share similar immune signatures with the initial GBMs except the proportion of GAMs decreases."

Here, we report extensive phenotypic analyses of HIV-infected endometrial cells by CyTOF, and use a 'nearest neighbor' bioinformatics approach to trace cells to their original pre-infection phenotypes. Like in blood, HIV preferentially targets memory CD4+ T cells in the endometrium, but these cells exhibit unique phenotypes and sustain much higher levels of infection. Genital cell remodeling by HIV includes downregulating TCR complex components and modulating chemokine receptor expression to promote dissemination of infected cells to lymphoid follicles. HIV also upregulates the anti-apoptotic protein BIRC5, which when blocked promotes death of infected endometrial cells. These results suggest that HIV remodels genital T cells to prolong viability and promote viral dissemination and that interfering with these processes might reduce the likelihood of systemic viral spread."

In this study, we used mass cytometry to define the systemic immune landscape in response to tumor development across five tissues in eight mouse tumor models. Systemic immunity was dramatically altered across models and time, with consistent findings in the peripheral blood of patients with breast cancer. Changes in peripheral tissues differed from those in the tumor microenvironment. Mice with tumor-experienced immune systems mounted dampened responses to orthogonal challenges, including reduced T cell activation during viral or bacterial infection. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) mounted weaker responses in this context, whereas promoting APC activation rescued T cell activity. Systemic immune changes were reversed with surgical tumor resection, and many were prevented by interleukin-1 or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor blockade, revealing remarkable plasticity in the systemic immune state. These results demonstrate that tumor development dynamically reshapes the composition and function of the immune macroenvironment."

We begin by discussing conventional characterization approaches, including fluorescence flow cytometry, mass cytometry, enzyme-linked immunospot assay, and capillary electrophoresis. We then detail the landmark advances of microfluidic approaches for analyzing single-cell protein expressions, including microfluidic fluorescent flow cytometry, droplet-based microfluidics, microwell-based assay (microengraving), microchamber-based assay (barcoding microchips), and single-cell Western blotting, among which the advantages and limitations are compared.

In an effort to bridge this gap, we evaluated cryopreserved PBMCs from 4 patients who survived Ebola virus disease (EVD) using an established mass cytometry antibody panel to characterize various cell populations during both the acute and convalescent phases. Acute loss of nonclassical monocytes and myeloid DCs, especially CD1c+ DCs, was noted. Classical monocyte proliferation and CD38 upregulation on plasmacytoid DCs coincided with declining viral load. Unsupervised analysis of cell abundance demonstrated acute declines in monocytic, NK, and T cell populations, but some populations, many of myeloid origin, increased in abundance during the acute phase, suggesting emergency hematopoiesis. Despite cell losses during the acute phase, upregulation of Ki-67 correlated with recovery of cell populations over time. These data provide insights into the human immune response during EVD."

Remarkably, this fine control is orchestrated using a limited set of intracellular machinery. It remains unclear whether changes in stimulation strength alter the programme of signalling events leading to T cell activation. Using mass cytometry to simultaneously measure multiple signalling pathways during activation of murine CD8+ T cells, we found a programme of distal signalling events that is shared, regardless of the strength of TCR stimulation. Moreover, the relationship between transcription of early response genes Nr4a1 and Irf8 and activation of the ribosomal protein S6 is also conserved across stimuli. Instead, we found that stimulation strength dictates the rate with which cells initiate signalling through this network. These data suggest that TCR-induced signalling results in a coordinated activation program, modulated in rate but not organization by stimulation strength."

In human subjects receiving placebo, we found a significant association between an increase in CD4+ TCM cells and the decline of β-cell function. To extend and refine these findings, we examined changes in human CD4+ and CD8+ naive and memory T cell subsets at greater resolution using polychromatic flow and mass cytometry. In the placebo group, we successfully reproduced the original finding of a significant association between TCM and β-cell function and extended this to other T cell subsets. Furthermore, we show that abatacept treatment significantly alters the frequencies of a majority of CD4+ conventional and regulatory T cell subsets; in general, Ag-naive subsets increase and Ag-experienced subsets decrease, whereas CD8+ T cell subsets are relatively resistant to drug effects, indicating a lesser reliance on CD28-mediated costimulation. Importantly, abatacept uncouples the relationship between changes in T cell subsets and β-cell function that is a component of the natural history of the disease. Although these data suggest immunological markers for predicting change in β-cell function in type 1 diabetes, the finding that abatacept blunts this relationship renders the biomarkers nonpredictive for this type of therapy. In sum, our findings point to a novel mechanism of action for this successful immunotherapy that may guide other disease-modifying approaches for type 1 diabetes."

We report that SAMHD1, a phosphohydrolase degrading deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), protects cells against the effects of dNTP imbalances. SAMHD1-deficient cells induce intrinsic apoptosis upon provision of deoxyribonucleosides, particularly deoxyguanosine (dG). Moreover, dG and forodesine act synergistically to kill cells lacking SAMHD1. Using mass cytometry, we find that these compounds kill SAMHD1-deficient malignant cells in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Normal cells and CLL cells from patients without SAMHD1 mutation are unaffected. We therefore propose to use forodesine as a precision medicine for leukemia, stratifying patients by SAMHD1 genotype or expression."

As a former treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), daclizumab beta induces robust expansion of the CD56bright subpopulation of NK cells that is correlated with the drug's therapeutic effects. As NK cells represent a heterogeneous population of lymphocytes with a range of phenotypes and functions, the goal of this study was to better understand how daclizumab beta altered the NK cell repertoire to provide further insight into the possible mechanism(s) of action in RMS. We used mass cytometry to evaluate expression patterns of NK cell markers and provide a comprehensive assessment of the NK cell repertoire in individuals with RMS treated with daclizumab beta or placebo over the course of 1 year. Treatment with daclizumab beta significantly altered the NK cell repertoire compared to placebo treatment. As previously reported, daclizumab beta significantly increased expression of CD56 on total NK cells. Within the CD56bright NK cells, treatment was associated with multiple phenotypic changes, including increased expression of NKG2A and NKp44, and diminished expression of CD244, CD57, and NKp46. These alterations occurred broadly across the CD56bright population, and were not associated with a specific subset of CD56bright NK cells. While the changes were less dramatic, CD56dim NK cells responded distinctly to daclizumab beta treatment, with higher expression of CD2 and NKG2A, and lower expression of FAS-L, HLA-DR, NTB-A, NKp30, and Perforin. Together, these data indicate that the expanded CD56bright NK cells share features of both immature and mature NK cells. These findings show that daclizumab beta treatment is associated with unique changes in NK cells that may enhance their ability to kill autoreactive T cells or to exert immunomodulatory functions."

In myopathies, the autocrine/paracrine constraints controlling FAP adipogenesis are released causing fat infiltrates. Here, by combining pharmacological screening, high-dimensional mass cytometry and in silico network modeling with the integration of single-cell/bulk RNA sequencing data, we highlighted the canonical WNT/GSK/β-catenin signaling as a crucial pathway modulating FAP adipogenesis triggered by insulin signaling. Consistently, pharmacological blockade of GSK3, by the LY2090314 inhibitor, stabilizes β-catenin and represses PPARγ expression abrogating FAP adipogenesis ex vivo while limiting fatty degeneration in vivo. Furthermore, GSK3 inhibition improves the FAP pro-myogenic role by efficiently stimulating, via follistatin secretion, muscle satellite cell (MuSC) differentiation into mature myotubes. Combining, publicly available single-cell RNAseq datasets, we characterize FAPs as the main source of WNT ligands inferring their potential in mediating autocrine/paracrine responses in the muscle niche. Lastly, we identify WNT5a, whose expression is impaired in dystrophic FAPs, as a crucial WNT ligand able to restrain the detrimental adipogenic differentiation drift of these cells through the positive modulation of the β-catenin signaling."

To identify new therapeutic targets, we profiled the immune regulatory signatures during murine cancer development using the BBN carcinogen and identified an increase in the expression of the T cell inhibitory protein B7-H4 (VTCN1, B7S1, B7X). B7-H4 expression temporally correlated with decreased lymphocyte infiltration. While the increase in B7-H4 expression within the bladder by CD11b+ monocytes is shared with human cancers, B7-H4 expression has not been previously identified in other murine cancer models. Higher expression of B7-H4 was associated with worse survival in muscle-invasive bladder cancer in humans, and increased B7-H4 expression was identified in luminal and luminal-papillary subtypes of bladder cancer. Evaluation of B7-H4 by single-cell RNA-Seq and immune mass cytometry of human bladder tumors found that B7-H4 is expressed in both the epithelium of urothelial carcinoma and CD68+ macrophages within the tumor. To investigate the function of B7-H4, treatment of human monocyte and T cell co-cultures with a B7-H4 blocking antibody resulted in enhanced IFN-γ secretion by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Additionally, anti-B7-H4 antibody treatment of BBN-carcinogen bladder cancers resulted in decreased tumor size, increased CD8+ T cell infiltration within the bladder, and a complimentary decrease in tumor-infiltrating T regulatory cells (Tregs). Furthermore, treatment with a combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-B7-H4 antibodies resulted in a significant reduction in tumor stage, a reduction in tumor size, and an increased level of tumor necrosis. These findings suggest that antibodies targeting B7-H4 may be a viable strategy for bladder cancers unresponsive to PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors."

Here, we study samples from 46 DENV-naive and 43 DENV-immune patients with RT-PCR-confirmed ZIKV infection at early-acute, late-acute, and convalescent time points from our pediatric cohort study in Nicaragua. We analyze the samples via RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), CyTOF, and multiplex cytokine/chemokine Luminex to generate a comprehensive, innate immune profile during ZIKV infection. Immunophenotyping and analysis of cytokines/chemokines reveal that CD14+ monocytes play a key role during ZIKV infection. Further, we identify CD169 (Siglec-1) on CD14+ monocytes as a potential biomarker of acute ZIKV infection. Strikingly distinct transcriptomic and immunophenotypic signatures are observed at all three time points. Interestingly, pre-existing dengue immunity has minimal impact on the innate immune response to Zika. Finally, this comprehensive immune profiling and network analysis of ZIKV infection in children serves as a valuable resource."

Epub 2020 Apr 27.,Keywords: 2D materials; CyTOF; biocompatibility; immune cells; safety.,"Considering the potential exposure to graphene, the most investigated nanomaterial, the assessment of the impact on human health has become an urgent need. The deep understanding of nanomaterial safety is today possible by high-throughput single-cell technologies. Single-cell mass cytometry (cytometry by time-of flight, CyTOF) shows an unparalleled ability to phenotypically and functionally profile complex cellular systems, in particular related to the immune system, as recently also proved for graphene impact. The next challenge is to track the graphene distribution at the single-cell level. Therefore, graphene oxide (GO) is functionalized with AgInS2 nanocrystals (GO-In), allowing to trace GO immune-cell interactions via the indium (115 In) channel. Indium is specifically chosen to avoid overlaps with the commercial panels (>30 immune markers). As a proof of concept, the GO-In CyTOF tracking is performed at the single-cell level on blood immune subpopulations, showing the GO interaction with monocytes and B cells, therefore guiding future immune studies. The proposed approach can be applied not only to the immune safety assessment of the multitude of graphene physical and chemical parameters, but also for graphene applications in neuroscience. Moreover, this approach can be translated to other 2D emerging materials and will likely advance the understanding of their toxicology."

Epub 2020 Apr 24.,Article has no keywords,"Circulating NK cells are known to convert to a type 1 innate lymphoid cell (ILC1)-like phenotype in response to TGF-β exposure. However, the precise cellular changes defining this process as well as the downstream signaling pathways guiding it remain poorly defined, particularly in humans. We used mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) to model this phenotypic shift in vitro and identify a synergistic activity of TGF-β and IL-15 in this cellular conversion. CyTOF profiling identified substantial heterogeneity in the propensity of NK cells to adopt an ILC1-like phenotype in culture, characterized by the step-wise acquisition of various markers, including CD69, CD9, CD103, and CD49a. Activating and inhibitory receptors, including NKG2A, NKG2D, KIR2DL1, KIR3DL1, NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46, were all found to be upregulated exclusively on the cellular subsets that converted most readily in response to TGF-β. An assessment of downstream TGF-β signaling identified TAK1-mediated activation of p38 MAPK as the critical pathway driving conversion. IL-15 enhanced TGF-β-mediated conversion through Ras:RAC1 signaling as well as via the activation of MEK/ERK. Interestingly, the adoption of an ILC1-like phenotype was independent of the effect of IL-15 or TGF-β on mTOR, as the culture of NK cells in the presence of mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin or torin1, had minimal impact on the degree of conversion. In conclusion, we have used in vitro human culture systems and CyTOF to define the conversion of circulating NK cells to an ILC1-like phenotype and have clarified the pathways responsible for this process."

Unfortunately, inter‑individual heterogeneity causes failure in controlling tumors in many patients. Emerging mass cytometry technology is capable of revealing a multiscale onco‑immune landscape that improves the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. We introduced mass cytometry to determine the personalized immune checkpoint status in bone marrow and peripheral blood samples from 3 patients with multiple myeloma, amyloid light‑chain amyloidosis, and solitary bone plasmacytoma and 1 non‑hematologic malignancy patient. The expression of 18 immune regulatory receptors and ligands on 17 defined cell populations was simultaneously examined. By single‑cell analyses, we identified the T cell clusters that serve as immunosuppressive signal source and revealed integrated immune checkpoint axes of individuals, thereby providing multiple potential immunotherapeutic targets, including programmed cell death protein 1 (PD‑1), inducible co‑stimulator (ICOS), and cluster of differentiation 28 (CD28), for each patient. Distinguishing the cell populations that function as providers and receivers of the immune checkpoint signals demonstrated a distinct cross‑interaction network of immunomodulatory signals in individuals. These in‑depth personalized data demonstrate mass cytometry as a powerful innovation to discover the systematical immune status in the primary and peripheral tumor microenvironment."

BMP signaling is rarely mutated and can be frequently overexpressed in many human cancers. The dichotomous role of BMPs as both tumor promoters and suppressors appears to be largely context based in both the cancer cell and the surrounding microenvironment. Myeloid cells including macrophages and neutrophils have been shown to be tumor promoting when stimulated from BMPs. We found that conditional deletion of BMPR1a in myeloid cells (LysMCre) restricts tumor progression in a syngeneic mouse prostate cancer model. Specific changes occurred in myeloid cells both in tumor bearing mice and tumor naïve mice throughout multiple tissues. We profiled myeloid subsets in the bone marrow, spleen and primary tumor and found myeloid BMPR1a loss altered the differentiation and lineage capability of distinct populations by histologic, flow cytometry and high dimensional mass cytometry analysis. We further confirmed the requirement for BMP signaling with pharmacologic inhibition of THP-1 and Raw264.7 activated into M2 macrophages with the BMP inhibitor DMH1. M2 polarized primary bone marrow derived cells from LysMCre BMPR1a knockout mice indicated a distinct requirement for BMP signaling in myeloid cells during M2 activation. These results indicate a unique necessity for BMP signaling in myeloid cells during tumor progression."

As a consequence, new computational techniques such as dimensionality reduction and/or clustering algorithms are necessary to analyze, clean, visualize, and interpret these high-dimensional data sets. In this small comparison study, we investigated splenocytes from the same sample by either MC or SFC and compared both high-dimensional data sets using expert gating, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) analysis and FlowSOM. When we downsampled each data set to their equivalent cell numbers and parameters, our analysis yielded highly comparable results. Differences between the data sets only became apparent when the maximum number of parameters in each data set were assessed, due to differences in the number of recorded events or the maximum number of assessed parameters. Overall, our small comparison study suggests that mass cytometry and spectral flow cytometry both yield comparable results when analyzed manually or by high-dimensional clustering or dimensionality reduction algorithms such as t-SNE, UMAP, or FlowSOM. However, large scale studies combined with an in-depth technical analysis will be needed to assess differences between these technologies in more detail. © 2020 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry."

To identify new non-invasive cellular biomarkers in the urine sediment of LN patients, which may reflect kidney inflammation and can be used to predict treatment outcome, we performed in-depth urinary immune cell profiling by mass cytometry. We established a mass cytometric workflow to comparatively analyze the cellular composition of urine and peripheral blood (PB) in 13 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with active, biopsy-proven proliferative LN. Clinical and laboratory data were collected at the time of sampling and 6 months after induction of therapy in order to evaluate the clinical response of each patient. Six patients with different acute inflammatory renal diseases were included as comparison group. Leukocyte phenotypes and composition differed significantly between urine and paired PB samples. In urine, neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages were identified as the most prominent cell populations comprising together about 30%-83% of nucleated cells, while T and B lymphocytes, eosinophils, and natural killer (NK) cells were detectable at frequencies of <10% each. The majority of urinary T cells showed phenotypical characteristics of activated effector memory T cells (EM) as indicated by the co-expression of CD38 and CD69 - a phenotype that was not detectable in PB. Kidney inflammation was also reflected by tissue-imprinted macrophages, which phenotypically differed from PB monocytes by an increased expression of HLA-DR and CD11c. The presence of activated urinary T cells and macrophages could be used for differential diagnosis of proliferative LN forms and other renal pathologies. Most interestingly, the amount of EM in the urine sediment could be used as a biomarker to stratify LN patients in terms of response to induction therapy. Deep immunophenotypic profiling of urinary cells in LN allowed us to identify a signature of activated T cells and macrophages, which appear to reflect leukocytic infiltrates in the kidney. This explorative study has not only confirmed but also extended the knowledge about urinary cells as a future non-invasive biomarker platform for diagnosis and precision medicine in inflammatory renal diseases."

Here we present an extensive evaluation of the ability of organoid culture technology to preserve complex stem/progenitor and differentiated cell types via long-term propagation of normal human mammary tissues. Basal/stem and luminal progenitor cells can differentiate in culture to generate mature basal and luminal cell types, including ER+ cells that have been challenging to maintain in culture. Cells associated with increased cancer risk can also be propagated. Single-cell analyses of matched organoid cultures and native tissues by mass cytometry for 38 markers provide a higher resolution representation of the multiple mammary epithelial cell types in the organoids, and demonstrate that protein expression patterns of the tissue of origin can be preserved in culture. These studies indicate that organoid cultures provide a valuable platform for studies of mammary differentiation, transformation, and breast cancer risk."

Multiparametric flow cytometry is particularly suitable for deep analysis of immune responses after vaccination, as it allows to measure the frequency, the phenotype, and the functional features of antigen-specific cells. When many parameters are investigated simultaneously, it is not feasible to analyze all the possible bi-dimensional combinations of marker expression with classical manual analysis and the adoption of advanced automated tools to process and analyze high-dimensional data sets becomes necessary. In recent years, the development of many tools for the automated analysis of multiparametric cytometry data has been reported, with an increasing record of publications starting from 2014. However, the use of these tools has been preferentially restricted to bioinformaticians, while few of them are routinely employed by the biomedical community. Filling the gap between algorithms developers and final users is fundamental for exploiting the advantages of computational tools in the analysis of cytometry data. The potentialities of automated analyses range from the improvement of the data quality in the pre-processing steps up to the unbiased, data-driven examination of complex datasets using a variety of algorithms based on different approaches. In this review, an overview of the automated analysis pipeline is provided, spanning from the pre-processing phase to the automated population analysis. Analysis based on computational tools might overcame both the subjectivity of manual gating and the operator-biased exploration of expected populations. Examples of applications of automated tools that have successfully improved the characterization of different cell populations in vaccination studies are also presented."

TRAIL receptor-deficient (Tnsf10 or Tr-/-) mice were crossbred with ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 4-deficient (Abcb4-/-, alias Mdr2-/-) mice. Male and female wild-type, Tr-/-, Mdr2-/-, and Tr-/-Mdr2-/- mice were assessed for liver injury, fibrosis, and ductular reactive (DR) cells. Macrophage subsets were examined by high-dimensional mass cytometry (time-of-flight mass cytometry). Mdr2-/- and Tr-/-Mdr2-/- mice had elevated liver weights and serum alanine transferase values. However, fibrosis was primarily periductular in Mdr2-/- mice, compared with extensive bridging fibrosis in Tr-/-Mdr2-/- mice. DR cell population was greatly expanded in the Tr-/-Mdr2-/- versus Mdr2-/- mice. The expanded DR cell population in Tr-/-Mdr2-/- mice was due to decreased cell loss by apoptosis and not enhanced proliferation. As assessed by time-of-flight mass cytometry, total macrophages were more abundant in Tr-/-Mdr2-/- versus Mdr2-/- mice, suggesting the DR cell population promotes macrophage-associated hepatic inflammation. Inhibition of monocyte-derived recruited macrophages using the CCR2/CCR5 antagonist cenicriviroc in the Mdr2-/- mice resulted in further expansion of the DR cell population. In conclusion, genetic deletion of TRAIL receptor increased the DR cell population, macrophage accumulation, and hepatic fibrosis in the Mdr2-/- model of cholestasis."

Currently, this technology can measure over 40 parameters simultaneously on individual cells using metal-chelating polymer (MCP) based reagents. However, MC can in principle detect up to 135 parameters with the development of new elemental mass tags. Here we report the development of a tantalum oxide nanoparticle (NP)-based mass tag for MC immunoassays. Uniform-sized amine-functionalized tantalum oxide NPs (d ∼ 5.7 nm) were synthesized via a one-pot two-step reverse microemulsion method. These amine-functionalized NPs were further modified with azide groups by reacting with azide-PEG2k succinimidyl carboxymethyl ester (NHS-PEG2k-N3) cross-linkers. The Ab-NP conjugates were prepared by reacting azide-functionalized NPs with dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)-functionalized primary or secondary Abs (DBCO-Ab) followed by fast protein size exclusion liquid chromatography (FPLC) purification. Three Ab-NP conjugates (TaO2-PEG2k-goat antimouse, TaO2-PEG2k-CD25, TaO2-PEG2k-CD196) were fabricated and tested in MC immunoassays. For the TaO2-PEG2k-goat antimouse conjugate, we showed that it can effectively detect abundant CD20 biomarkers on Ramos cells. For TaO2-PEG2k-CD25 and TaO2-PEG2k-CD196 conjugates, we demonstrated that these Ab-NP conjugates could be integrated into the commercial Ab staining panels for high-dimensional single-cell immune profiling of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells."

We found a high frequency of TRMs at all infection sites apart from the peripheral blood. These TRMs exhibited a memory phenotype, were highly activated (based on CD38 and HLA-DR expression), and expressed high levels of trafficking (CCR5 and CXCR6) and exhaustion (PD-1) markers. When stimulated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, TRMs secreted cytokines, including IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2, and exhibited a multifunctional phenotype. TRMs limited intracellular M. tuberculosis replication in macrophages. These data inform our current understanding of immunosurveillance at different infection sites in patients with TB."

The basis for this transition is unknown. To evaluate a role for lymphocyte polarization, we characterized T cells from patients with acute and chronic sJIA using flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and RNA sequencing. Acute and chronic sJIA each featured an expanded population of activated Tregs uncommon in healthy controls or in children with nonsystemic JIA. In acute sJIA, Tregs expressed IL-17A and a gene expression signature reflecting Th17 polarization. In chronic sJIA, the Th17 transcriptional signature was identified in T effector cells (Teffs), although expression of IL-17A at the protein level remained rare. Th17 polarization was abrogated in patients responding to IL-1 blockade. These findings identify evolving Th17 polarization in sJIA that begins in Tregs and progresses to Teffs, likely reflecting the impact of the cytokine milieu and consistent with a biphasic model of disease pathogenesis. The results support T cells as a potential treatment target in sJIA."

A limited number of studies, largely performed on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), has provided evidence in support of this hypothesis, but whether similar changes occur in circulating blood lymphocytes has received little attention. In the present study, a comprehensive analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes from 42 patients taken over the course of treatment with anti-PD-1 was undertaken. The patients included those grouped as responders (who did not progress), primary non-responders (primary resistance) and those with acquired resistance (who initially responded then subsequently progressed). Analysis included surface markers of exhaustion, production of cytokines following in vitro stimulation, and assessment of transcription factor levels associated with T cell exhaustion. There were differences in innate cell populations between responders and non-responders at baseline and maintained throughout therapy. Frequencies of total and classical CD14+CD16- monocytes were higher and the major subset of NK cells (CD16hiCD56+) was significantly smaller in the primary resistance group compared with responders. However, differences in peripheral blood expression of exhaustion markers were not evident between the treatment groups. T cell exhaustion markers were expressed in practically all patients and the major observation was an increase in CD39 on CD4 T cells during treatment. The results confirm the association of Eomes transcription factor with T cell exhaustion but levels of expression and the ratio with T-bet over Eomes did not differ between the patient groups. Thus, peripheral blood expression of T cell exhaustion markers does not distinguish between responders and non-responders to anti-PD-1 therapy. CD4 T cell expression of IFNγ also differed in pre-treatment samples, indicating that predictors of response unrelated to exhaustion may be present in peripheral blood. The association of response with innate cell populations and CD4 T cell responses requires further study."

The small molecular probe was synthesized by conjugating 167Er-polymeric pentetic acid (167Er-DTPA) with an RNA aptamer A10-3.2. For demonstration, 167Er-A10-3.2 was applied for observing protein spatial distribution on prostatic epithelium cell of paraffin embedded Prostatic adenocarcinoma (PaC) tissue sections by IMC technology. The 167Er-A10-3.2 capitalizes on the ability of the aptamer to specifically bind target cancer cells as well as the small size of 167Er-A10-3.2 can accommodate multiple aptamer binding antigen labeled at high density. The detection signal of 167Er-A10-3.2 probe was 3-fold higher than that of PSMA antibody probe for a targeted cell under lower temperature epitope retrieval (37 °C) of PaC tissue.

The design of particles with enhanced aerodynamic properties can improve lung distribution and deposition, and hence the efficacy of encapsulated inhaled drugs. This study describes the nanoengineering and nebulization of metal-phenolic capsules as pulmonary carriers of small molecule drugs and macromolecular drugs in lung cell lines, a human lung model, and mice. Tuning the aerodynamic diameter by increasing the capsule shell thickness (from ≈100 to 200 nm in increments of ≈50 nm) through repeated film deposition on a sacrificial template allows precise control of capsule deposition in a human lung model, corresponding to a shift from the alveolar region to the bronchi as aerodynamic diameter increases. The capsules are biocompatible and biodegradable, as assessed following intratracheal administration in mice, showing >85% of the capsules in the lung after 20 h, but <4% remaining after 30 days without causing lung inflammation or toxicity. Single-cell analysis from lung digests using mass cytometry shows association primarily with alveolar macrophages, with >90% of capsules remaining nonassociated with cells. The amenability to nebulization, capacity for loading, tunable aerodynamic properties, high biocompatibility, and biodegradability make these capsules attractive for controlled pulmonary delivery."

Research in the HIV-1 field is no exception: the challenges encountered in the development of preventive and curative anti-HIV-1 strategies may well originate in part from inadequate assumptions built on bulk technologies, highlighting the need for new perspectives. The emergence of diverse single-cell technologies set the stage for potential breakthrough discoveries, as heterogeneous processes can now be investigated with an unprecedented depth in topics as diverse as HIV-1 tropism, dynamics of the replication cycle, latency, viral reservoirs and immune control.

To characterize these alterations in immune cell populations, we performed time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) analysis of CD45-expressing immune cells in whole lung parenchyma and the bronchoalveolar space of mice, exposed to 48 hours of hyperoxia together with normoxic controls. At the tested time point, hyperoxia exposure resulted in decreased abundance of immunoregulatory populations (regulatory B cells, myeloid regulatory cells) in lung parenchyma and markedly decreased proliferation rates of myeloid regulatory cells, monocytes and alveolar macrophages. Additionally, hyperoxia caused a shift in the phenotype of alveolar macrophages, increasing proportion of cells with elevated CD68, CD44, CD11c, PD-L1, and CD205 expression levels. These changes occurred in the absence of histologically evident alveolar damage and abundance of neutrophils in the parenchyma or alveolar space did not change at these time points. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that pulmonary response to hyperoxia involves marked changes in specific subsets of myeloid and lymphoid populations. These findings have important implications for therapeutic targeting in acute lung injury."

However, conventional assays may be insufficient in describing the complexity and heterogeneity of cell-NP interactions. Herein, mass cytometry and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) are complementarily used to investigate the heterogeneous interactions between silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and primary immune cells. Mass cytometry reveals the heterogeneous biodistribution of the positively charged polyethylenimine-coated AgNPs in various cell types and finds that monocytes and B cells have higher association with the AgNPs than other populations. scRNA-seq data of these two cell types demonstrate that each type has distinct responses to AgNP treatment: NRF2-mediated oxidative stress is confined to B cells, whereas monocytes show Fcγ-mediated phagocytosis. Besides the between-population heterogeneity, analysis of single-cell dose-response relationships further reveals within-population diversity for the B cells and naïve CD4+ T cells.

The frequency of CD20loCD27hiCD38hiHLA-DRint plasmablasts, CD86+CD14loCD16+ non-classical monocytes and two subsets of CD56dimHLA-DR+IFN-γ+ NK cells were increased in patients with HT. Subsets of CD56dimCD69+HLA-DR- NK cells and CD8+ TEMRA cells, both expressing IFN-γ, were expanded and reduced, respectively, in the N-T1D group. In addition, patients with AD were characterized by an increased percentage of central memory CD8+ T cells that expressed CCR4, GATA3, and IL-2. We demonstrate that patients with N-T1D, HT, and AD had altered frequencies of distinct subsets within antigen-presenting and cytotoxic cell lineages. Previously unreported alterations of specific cell subsets were identified in samples from patients with HT and AD.

Accurate characterisation of cellular phenotype, intercellular signalling networks, and the spatial organisation of cells within organs is crucial to deliver a better understanding of the processes underpinning physiology, and the perturbations that lead to disease. Single-cell methodologies have increased rapidly in scale and scope in recent years and are set to generate important insights into human disease. Here, we review current practices in nephropathology, which are dominated by relatively simple morphological descriptions of tissue biopsies based on their appearance using light microscopy. Bulk transcriptomics have more recently been used to explore glomerular and tubulointerstitial kidney disease, renal cancer, and the responses to injury and alloimmunity in kidney transplantation, generating novel disease insights and prognostic biomarkers. These studies set the stage for single-cell transcriptomic approaches that reveal cell-type-specific gene expression patterns in health and disease. These technologies allow genome-wide disease susceptibility genes to be interpreted with the knowledge of the specific cell populations within organs that express them, identifying candidate cell types for further study. Single-cell technologies are also moving beyond assaying individual cellular transcriptomes, to measuring the epigenetic landscape of single cells. Single-cell antigen-receptor gene sequencing also enables specific T- and B-cell clones to be tracked in different tissues and disease states. In the coming years these rich 'multi-omic' descriptions of kidney disease will enable histopathological descriptions to be comprehensively integrated with molecular phenotypes, enabling better disease classification and prognostication and the application of personalised treatment strategies. © 2020 The Authors.

Successful regeneration requires the recovery of both quantity and quality of immune cell subsets. Although immune cell numbers rebound within a year after treatment, it is unclear whether overall compositional diversity is recovered. We investigated the regeneration of immune cell complexity by comparing peripheral blood mononuclear cells from breast cancer patients ranging from 1-5 years after chemotherapy with those of age-matched healthy controls using mass cytometry and T cell receptor sequencing. These data reveal universal changes in patients' CD4+ T cells that persisted for years and consisted of expansion of Th17-like CD4 memory populations with incomplete recovery of CD4+ naive T cells. Conversely, CD8+ T cells fully recovered within a year. Mechanisms of T cell regeneration, however, were unbiased, as CD4+ and CD8+ T cell receptor diversity remained high. Likewise, terminal differentiated effector memory cells were not expanded, indicating that regeneration was not driven by recognition of latent viruses. These data suggest that, while CD8+ T cell immunity is successfully regenerated, the CD4 compartment may be irreversibly affected. Moreover, the bias of CD4 memory toward inflammatory effector cells may impact responses to vaccination and infection."

Currently, there is a growing literature on algorithms that exploit this attribute in order to infer the trajectory of biological mechanisms, such as cell proliferation and differentiation. Despite the efforts, the trajectory inference methodology has not yet been used for addressing the challenging problem of learning the dynamics of protein signaling systems. In this work, we assess this prospect by testing the performance of this class of algorithms on four proteomic temporal datasets. To evaluate the learning quality, we design new general-purpose evaluation metrics that are able to quantify performance on (i) the biological meaning of the output, (ii) the consistency of the inferred trajectory, (iii) the algorithm robustness, (iv) the correlation of the learning output with the initial dataset, and (v) the roughness of the cell parameter levels though the inferred trajectory. We show that experimental time alone is insufficient to provide knowledge about the order of proteins during signal transduction. Accordingly, we show that the inferred trajectories provide richer information about the underlying dynamics. We learn that established methods tested on high-dimensional data with small sample size, slow dynamics, and complex structures (e.g. bifurcations) cannot always work in the signaling setting. Among the methods we evaluate, Scorpius and a newly introduced approach that combines Diffusion Maps and Principal Curves were found to perform adequately in recovering the progression of signal transduction although their performance on some metrics varies from one dataset to another. The novel metrics we devise highlight that it is difficult to conclude, which one method is universally applicable for the task.

Print 2020 Apr 16.,Keywords: IRF5; dendritic cells; iPSCs; inflammation; influenza.,"Recognition of influenza A virus (IAV) by the innate immune system triggers pathways that restrict viral replication, activate innate immune cells, and regulate adaptive immunity. However, excessive innate immune activation can exaggerate disease. The pathways promoting excessive activation are incompletely understood, with limited experimental models to investigate the mechanisms driving influenza virus-induced inflammation in humans. Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) is a transcription factor that plays important roles in the induction of cytokines after viral sensing. In an in vivo model of IAV infection, IRF5 deficiency reduced IAV-driven immune pathology and associated inflammatory cytokine production, specifically reducing cytokine-producing myeloid cell populations in Irf5-/- mice but not impacting type 1 interferon (IFN) production or virus replication. Using cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF), we identified that human lung IRF5 expression was highest in cells of the myeloid lineage. To investigate the role of IRF5 in mediating human inflammatory responses by myeloid cells to IAV, we employed human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSCs) with biallelic mutations in IRF5, demonstrating for the first time that induced pluripotent stem cell-derived dendritic cells (iPS-DCs) with biallelic mutations can be used to investigate the regulation of human virus-induced immune responses. Using this technology, we reveal that IRF5 deficiency in human DCs, or macrophages, corresponded with reduced virus-induced inflammatory cytokine production, with IRF5 acting downstream of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and, possibly, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) after viral sensing. Thus, IRF5 acts as a regulator of myeloid cell inflammatory cytokine production during IAV infection in mice and humans and drives immune-mediated viral pathogenesis independently of type 1 IFN and virus replication.IMPORTANCE The inflammatory response to influenza A virus (IAV) participates in infection control but contributes to disease severity. After viral detection, intracellular pathways are activated, initiating cytokine production, but these pathways are incompletely understood. We show that interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) mediates IAV-induced inflammation and, in mice, drives pathology. This was independent of antiviral type 1 IFN and virus replication, implying that IRF5 could be specifically targeted to treat influenza virus-induced inflammation. We show for the first time that human iPSC technology can be exploited in genetic studies of virus-induced immune responses. Using this technology, we deleted IRF5 in human myeloid cells. These IRF5-deficient cells exhibited impaired influenza virus-induced cytokine production and revealed that IRF5 acts downstream of Toll-like receptor 7 and possibly retinoic acid-inducible gene I. Our data demonstrate the importance of IRF5 in influenza virus-induced inflammation, suggesting that genetic variation in the IRF5 gene may influence host susceptibility to viral diseases."

Although CAFs have been shown to promote tumor growth and mediate resistance to chemotherapy, the mechanisms by which they may contribute to immune suppression within the tumor microenvironment (TME) in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) remain largely unexplored. Here, we identified a positive correlation between CAF and monocytic myeloid cell abundances in 501 primary LSCCs by mining The Cancer Genome Atlas data sets. We further validated this finding in an independent cohort using imaging mass cytometry and found a significant spatial interaction between CAFs and monocytic myeloid cells in the TME. To delineate the interplay between CAFs and monocytic myeloid cells, we used chemotaxis assays to show that LSCC patient-derived CAFs promoted recruitment of CCR2+ monocytes via CCL2, which could be reversed by CCR2 inhibition. Using a three-dimensional culture system, we found that CAFs polarized monocytes to adopt a myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) phenotype, characterized by robust suppression of autologous CD8+ T-cell proliferation and IFNγ production. We further demonstrated that inhibiting IDO1 and NADPH oxidases, NOX2 and NOX4, restored CD8+ T-cell proliferation by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in CAF-induced MDSCs. Taken together, our study highlights a pivotal role of CAFs in regulating monocyte recruitment and differentiation and demonstrated that CCR2 inhibition and ROS scavenging abrogate the CAF-MDSC axis, illuminating a potential therapeutic path to reversing the CAF-mediated immunosuppressive microenvironment."

Here, we utilize a mouse model system to investigate the immunopathological consequences following ZIKV infection of the rectal mucosa compared to a subcutaneous route of infection. We show that ZIKV-rectal inoculation results in viremia with subclinical infection. ZIKV infects the mucosal epithelium and submucosal dendritic cells, inducing immune and inflammatory cell infiltration. Rectal transmission of ZIKV resulted in the generation of serum-neutralizing antibody responses. Mass cytometry analyses of splenocytes showed a significantly reduced level of inflammatory monocyte and neutrophil cellular responses in the rectal route group. Furthermore, immunological priming through the rectal mucosa with an attenuated ZIKV strain resulted in significant protection from lethal subcutaneous ZIKV challenge, further eliciting robust memory CD4-positive (CD4+) and CD8+ T-cell and ZIKV-specific serum-neutralizing antibody responses. Thus, our study provides deeper immunopathobiological insights on rectal transmission and highlights a rational strategy for mucosal immunization. This model system recapitulates clinical aspects of human ZIKV disease outcome, where most infections are well controlled and result in subclinical and asymptomatic outcomes.IMPORTANCE Zika virus is a clinically significant human pathogen that is primarily transmitted and spread by Aedes species mosquitoes but is also sexually transmissible. The recent pandemic in the Americas led to an unprecedented increase of newborn babies with developmental brain and eye abnormalities. To date, there is no licensed vaccine or therapeutic intervention available for the fight against ZIKV. Understanding the sexual transmission of ZIKV through vaginal and rectal routes is necessary to restrict virus transmission and spread. This study examines the early immunological and pathological consequences of rectal and subcutaneous routes of ZIKV infection using a mouse model. We characterized the primary target cells of ZIKV infection and the subsequent mucosal immune responses to infection, and we demonstrate the protective effect of mucosal rectal immunization using an attenuated ZIKV strain. This mucosal vaccination approach can be further developed to prevent future ZIKV outbreaks."

Epub 2020 Feb 11.,Keywords: B cell antigen receptor (BCR); autonomous BCR signaling; chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); immunoglobulin allele IGLV3-21*01.,"The prognosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) depends on different markers, including cytogenetic aberrations, oncogenic mutations, and mutational status of the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy-chain variable (IGHV) gene. The number of IGHV mutations distinguishes mutated (M) CLL with a markedly superior prognosis from unmutated (UM) CLL cases. In addition, B cell antigen receptor (BCR) stereotypes as defined by IGHV usage and complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) classify ∼30% of CLL cases into prognostically important subsets. Subset 2 expresses a BCR with the combination of IGHV3-21-derived heavy chains (HCs) with IGLV3-21-derived light chains (LCs), and is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Importantly, the subset 2 LC carries a single-point mutation, termed R110, at the junction between the variable and constant LC regions. By analyzing 4 independent clinical cohorts through BCR sequencing and by immunophenotyping with antibodies specifically recognizing wild-type IGLV3-21 and R110-mutated IGLV3-21 (IGLV3-21R110), we show that IGLV3-21R110-expressing CLL represents a distinct subset with poor prognosis independent of IGHV mutations. Compared with other alleles, only IGLV3-21*01 facilitates effective homotypic BCR-BCR interaction that results in autonomous, oncogenic BCR signaling after acquiring R110 as a single-point mutation. Presumably, this mutation acts as a standalone driver that transforms IGLV3-21*01-expressing B cells to develop CLL. Thus, we propose to expand the conventional definition of CLL subset 2 to subset 2L by including all IGLV3-21R110-expressing CLL cases regardless of IGHV mutational status. Moreover, the generation of monoclonal antibodies recognizing IGLV3-21 or mutated IGLV3-21R110 facilitates the recognition of B cells carrying this mutation in CLL patients or healthy donors."

The ability to profile more than 40 markers per cell is particularly relevant for the differentiation of cell types for which low parametric characterization has proven difficult, such as exhausted CD8+ T cells (TEX). TEX with limited effector function accumulate in many chronic infections and cancers and are subject to inhibitory signaling mediated by several immune checkpoints (e.g., PD-1). Of note, TEX represent considerable targets for immune-stimulatory therapies and are beginning to be recognized as a major correlate of successful checkpoint blockade approaches targeting the PD-1 pathway. TEX exhibit substantial functional, transcriptomic and epigenomic differences compared to canonical functional T cell subsets [such as naïve (TN), effector (TEFF) and memory T cells (TMEM)]. However, phenotypic distinction of TEX from TEFF and TMEM can often be challenging since many molecules expressed by TEX can also be expressed by effector and memory T cell populations. Moreover, significant heterogeneity of TEX has been described, such as subpopulations of exhausted T cells with progenitor-progeny relationships or populations with different degrees of exhaustion or homeostatic potential that may directly inform about disease progression. In addition, TEX subsets have essential clinical implications as they differentially respond to antiviral and checkpoint therapies. The precise assessment of TEX thus requires a high-parametric analysis that accounts for differences to canonical T cell populations as well as for TEX subset heterogeneity. In this review, we discuss how mass cytometry can be used to reveal the role of TEX subsets in humans by combining exhaustion-directed phenotyping with functional profiling. Mass cytometry analysis of human TEX populations is instrumental to gain a better understanding of TEX in chronic infections and cancer. It has important implications for immune monitoring in therapeutic settings aiming to boost T cell immunity, such as during cancer immunotherapy."

The recent emergence of novel single-cell techniques, such as cytometry by time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CyTOF) and single-cell RNA sequencing, enabled scientists to overcome such limitations and reveal the surprising context-dependent heterogeneity of microglia.

Many studies have shone light on the different phenotypes and functions that macrophages can acquire upon exposure to local cues. The microenvironment of the atherosclerotic plaque contains a plethora of macrophage-controlling factors, such as cytokines, oxidised low-density lipoproteins and cell debris. Previous research has determined macrophage function within the plaque mainly by using immunohistochemistry and bulk analysis. The recent development and rapid progress of single-cell technologies, such as cytometry by time of flight and single-cell RNA sequencing, now enable comprehensive mapping of the wide range of cell types and their phenotypes present in atherosclerotic plaques. In this review we discuss recent advances applying these technologies in defining macrophage subsets residing in the atherosclerotic arterial wall of mice and men. Resulting from these studies, we describe three main macrophage subsets: resident-like, pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory foamy TREM2hi macrophages, which are found in both mouse and human atherosclerotic plaques. Furthermore, we discuss macrophage subset-specific markers and functions.

Integrative transcriptome analyses were used to investigate how TP-0903, an AXL kinase inhibitor, influences redundant oncogenic pathways in metastatic lung cancer cells. CyTOF profiling revealed that AXL inhibition suppressed SMAD4/TGFβ signaling and induced JAK1-STAT3 signaling to compensate for the loss of AXL. Interestingly, high JAK1-STAT3 was associated with increased levels of AXL in treatment-naïve tumors. Tumors with high AXL, TGFβ, and JAK1 signaling concomitantly displayed CD133-mediated cancer stemness and hybrid epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition features in advanced-stage patients, suggesting greater potential for distant dissemination. Diffusion pseudotime analysis revealed cell-fate trajectories among four different categories that were linked to clinicopathologic features for each patient. Patient-derived organoids (PDO) obtained from tumors with high AXL and JAK1 were sensitive to TP-0903 and ruxolitinib (JAK inhibitor) treatments, supporting the CyTOF findings. This study shows that single-cell proteomic profiling of treatment-naïve lung tumors, coupled with ex vivo testing of PDOs, identifies continuous AXL, TGFβ, and JAK1-STAT3 signal activation in select tumors that may be targeted by combined AXL-JAK1 inhibition.

Our approach recapitulated known signaling relationships, such as connection within the JAK/STAT pathway, and was further validated in characterizing perturbed signaling network with PI3K, MEK1/2 and AMPK inhibitors."

Therefore, harmonization and standardization of techniques for the characterization of peripheral and tissue-resident γδ T cells is crucial to facilitate comparability between published and emerging research. The application of commercially available reagents to classify γδ T cells, in particular the combination of multiple Abs, is not always trouble-free, posing major demands on researchers entering this field. Occasionally, even entire γδ T cell subsets may remain undetected when certain Abs are combined in flow cytometric analysis with multicolor Ab panels, or might be lost during cell isolation procedures. Here, based on the recent literature and our own experience, we provide an overview of methods commonly employed for the phenotypic and functional characterization of human γδ T cells including advanced polychromatic flow cytometry, mass cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and magnetic cell isolation. We highlight potential pitfalls and discuss how to circumvent these obstacles."

Metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM), typically occurring in the liver, is one of the most refractory tumours to ICIs and has dismal outcomes. Monosomy 3 (M3), polysomy 8q, and BAP1 loss in primary uveal melanoma (pUM) are associated with poor prognoses. The presence of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) within pUM and surrounding mUM - and some evidence of clinical responses to adoptive TIL transfer - strongly suggests that UMs are indeed immunogenic despite their low mutational burden. The mechanisms that suppress TILs in pUM and mUM are unknown. We show that BAP1 loss is correlated with upregulation of several genes associated with suppressive immune responses, some of which build an immune suppressive axis, including HLA-DR, CD38, and CD74. Further, single-cell analysis of pUM by mass cytometry confirmed the expression of these and other markers revealing important functions of infiltrating immune cells in UM, most being regulatory CD8+ T lymphocytes and tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs). Transcriptomic analysis of hepatic mUM revealed similar immune profiles to pUM with BAP1 loss, including the expression of IDO1. At the protein level, we observed TAMs and TILs entrapped within peritumoural fibrotic areas surrounding mUM, with increased expression of IDO1, PD-L1, and β-catenin (CTNNB1), suggesting tumour-driven immune exclusion and hence the immunotherapy resistance. These findings aid the understanding of how the immune response is organised in BAP1 - mUM, which will further enable functional validation of detected biomarkers and the development of focused immunotherapeutic approaches. © 2020 The Authors.

Following stimulation, dNK2 and dNK3 produce more chemokines than dNK1 including XCL1 which can act on both maternal dendritic cells and fetal EVT. In contrast, dNK1 express receptors including Killer-cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIR), indicating they respond to HLA class I ligands on EVT.

Here we aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of circulating LDN in lung cancer patients, and further assessed its diagnostic vs prognostic value. Using mass cytometry (CyTOF), we identified major subpopulations within the circulating LDN/HDN subsets and determined phenotypic modulations of these subsets along tumor progression. LDN were highly enriched in the low-density (LD) fraction of advanced lung cancer patients (median 7.0%; range 0.2%-80%, n = 64), but not in early stage patients (0.7%; 0.05%-6%; n = 35), healthy individuals (0.8%; 0%-3.5%; n = 15), or stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients (1.2%; 0.3%-7.4%, n = 13). Elevated LDN (>10%) remarkably related with poorer prognosis in late stage patients. We identified three main neutrophil subsets which proportions are markedly modified in cancer patients, with CD66b+ /CD10low /CXCR4+ /PDL1inter subset almost exclusively found in advanced lung cancer patients. We found substantial variability in subsets between patients, and demonstrated that HDN and LDN retain a degree of inherent spontaneous plasticity.

We report here a minimum cell cycle panel for MC consisting of Ir-intercalator (DNA content), IdU (S phase), anti-pS28HistoneH3 (mitosis), anti-CDT1 (G1 phase) and anti-Geminin (non-G1 phases). Cell cycle distributions obtained by MC were not significantly different from fluorescence flow cytometry results (r2 = 0.98, P < 0.001). Further subdivision of the G1 and G2 phases could be done with anti-pS780RB1 (late G1 ) and anti-PLK1 (late G2 ), respectively. A disadvantage of MC is that aggregates of cells cannot easily be removed while retaining all single cells. We have developed an analysis pipeline including unsupervised clustering by FlowSOM and subsequent single-cell gating. When performed on cells stained with the cell cycle panel, this analysis pipeline successfully identified debris, dead/apoptotic cells, nonsingle-cell populations and the major cell cycle phases. The presented cell cycle panel and analysis pipeline thus achieves true single-cell analysis at the same time as any additional channels in the panel are open for phenotyping and cell cycle-resolved expression or modification analysis. © 2020 The Authors.

A previously conducted neoadjuvant ICB trial in patients with melanoma showed via targeted expression profiling17 that B cell signatures were enriched in the tumours of patients who respond to treatment versus non-responding patients. To build on this, here we performed bulk RNA sequencing and found that B cell markers were the most differentially expressed genes in the tumours of responders versus non-responders. Our findings were corroborated using a computational method (MCP-counter18) to estimate the immune and stromal composition in this and two other ICB-treated cohorts (patients with melanoma and renal cell carcinoma). Histological evaluation highlighted the localization of B cells within tertiary lymphoid structures. We assessed the potential functional contributions of B cells via bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, which demonstrate clonal expansion and unique functional states of B cells in responders. Mass cytometry showed that switched memory B cells were enriched in the tumours of responders. Together, these data provide insights into the potential role of B cells and tertiary lymphoid structures in the response to ICB treatment, with implications for the development of biomarkers and therapeutic targets."

Although infection elicits neutralizing antibodies, these do not persist or cross-protect across multiple rhinovirus strains. To analyze rhinovirus-specific B cell responses in humans, we developed techniques using intact RV-A16 and RV-A39 for high-throughput high-dimensional single-cell analysis, with parallel assessment of antibody isotypes in an experimental infection model. Our approach identified T-bet+ B cells binding both viruses that account for ∼5% of CXCR5- memory B cells. These B cells infiltrate nasal tissue and expand in the blood after infection. Their rapid secretion of heterotypic immunoglobulin G (IgG) in vitro, but not IgA, matches the nasal antibody profile post-infection. By contrast, CXCR5+ memory B cells binding a single virus are clonally distinct, absent in nasal tissue, and secrete homotypic IgG and IgA, mirroring the systemic response. Temporal and spatial functions of dichotomous memory B cells might explain the ability to resolve infection while rendering the host susceptible to re-infection."

This approach can be applied to many dynamic processes, including in vitro stem cell differentiation, in vivo development, oncogenesis, the emergence of drug resistance and cell signaling dynamics. To demonstrate our approach, we perform a step-by-step analysis of a single-cell mass cytometry time course dataset from mouse embryonic stem cells differentiating into the three germ layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. In addition, we demonstrate FLOW-MAP analysis of a previously published scRNAseq dataset. Using both synthetic and experimental datasets for comparison, we perform FLOW-MAP analysis side by side with other single-cell analysis methods, to illustrate when it is advantageous to use the FLOW-MAP approach.

However, these technologies are destructive, and require analysis approaches that temporally map between cell state distributions across time points. Current approaches to approximate the single-cell time series as a dynamical system suffer from too restrictive assumptions about the type of kinetics, or link together pairs of sequential measurements in a discontinuous fashion. We propose Dynamic Distribution Decomposition (DDD), an operator approximation approach to infer a continuous distribution map between time points. On the basis of single-cell snapshot time series data, DDD approximates the continuous time Perron-Frobenius operator by means of a finite set of basis functions. This procedure can be interpreted as a continuous time Markov chain over a continuum of states. By only assuming a memoryless Markov (autonomous) process, the types of dynamics represented are more general than those represented by other common models, e.g., chemical reaction networks, stochastic differential equations. Furthermore, we can a posteriori check whether the autonomy assumptions are valid by calculation of prediction error-which we show gives a measure of autonomy within the studied system. The continuity and autonomy assumptions ensure that the same dynamical system maps between all time points, not arbitrarily changing at each time point. We demonstrate the ability of DDD to reconstruct dynamically important cell states and their transitions both on synthetic data, as well as on mass cytometry time series of iPSC reprogramming of a fibroblast system. We use DDD to find previously identified subpopulations of cells and to visualise differentiation trajectories. Dynamic Distribution Decomposition allows interpretation of high-dimensional snapshot time series data as a low-dimensional Markov process, thereby enabling an interpretable dynamics analysis for a variety of biological processes by means of identifying their dynamically important cell states."

Macrophages provide essential mechanisms of tumor immune evasion through checkpoint ligand expression and secretion of suppressive cytokines. However, normal and tumor-associated macrophage phenotypes are less well characterized than those of tumor-infiltrating T-cell subsets, and it would be especially valuable to know whether the polarization state of macrophages differs across lymphoma tumor microenvironments. Here, an established mass cytometry panel designed to characterize myeloid-derived suppressor cells and known macrophage maturation and polarization states was applied to characterize B-lymphoma tumors and non-malignant human tissue. High-dimensional single-cell analyses were performed using dimensionality reduction and clustering tools. Phenotypically distinct intra-tumor macrophage subsets were identified based on abnormal marker expression profiles that were associated with lymphoma tumor types. While it had been proposed that measurement of CD163 and CD68 might be sufficient to reveal macrophage subsets in tumors, results here indicated that S100A9, CCR2, CD36, Slan, and CD32 should also be measured to effectively characterize lymphoma-specific tumor macrophages. Additionally, the presence of phenotypically distinct, abnormal macrophage populations was closely linked to the phenotype of intra-tumor T-cell populations, including PD-1 expressing T cells. These results further support the close links between macrophage polarization and T-cell functional state, as well as the rationale for targeting tumor-associated macrophages in cancer immunotherapies."

These results reveal an adaptive immune response in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid in Alzheimer's disease and provide evidence of clonal, antigen-experienced T cells patrolling the intrathecal space of brains affected by age-related neurodegeneration."

Therefore, complete understanding of T-cell phenotypes and functional status in the CRC microenvironment is desirable. Here, we applied single-cell mass cytometry to mold the T-cell phenotype in 18 patients with MSS CRC for better understanding of CRC as a systemic disease and to search for tumor-driven T-cell profile changes. We show interpatient and intrapatient phenotypic diversity of T-cell subsets. We revealed increased immunosuppressive/exhausted T-cell phenotypes at tumor lesions. CD8+ CD28- immunosenescent T cells with impaired proliferation capacity dominate the T-cell compartment. As per the transcriptome and quantitative real time-PCR analysis, the accumulation of immunosuppressive cells is driven by the tumor microenvironment. T-cell profiles are similar between patients at early and late stages, indicating that the immunosuppressive microenvironment is formulated early during CRC development. Mapping of T-cell infiltration and understanding of the mechanisms underlying their regulation may provide valuable information to boost the immune response in patients with MSS CRC."

The aldo-keto reductase (AKR)1C3 regulates androgen receptor (AR) activity in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) by promoting tumor tissue androgen biosynthesis from adrenal DHEA and also by functioning as an AR-selective coactivator. Herein we report that SULT2B-depleted CRPC cells, arising from stable RNA interference or gene knockout (KO), are markedly upregulated for AKR1C3, activated for ERK1/2 survival signal, and induced for epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT)-like changes. EMT was evident from increased mesenchymal proteins and elevated EMT-inducing transcription factors SNAI1 and TWIST1 in immunoblot and single-cell mass cytometry analyses. SULT2B KO cells showed greater motility and invasion in vitro; growth escalation in xenograft study; and enhanced metastatic potential predicted on the basis of decreased cell stiffness and adhesion revealed from atomic force microscopy analysis. While AR and androgen levels were unchanged, AR activity was elevated, since PSA and FKBP5 mRNA induction by DHT-activated AR was several-fold higher in SULT2B-silenced cells. AKR1C3 silencing prevented ERK1/2 activation and SNAI1 induction in SULT2B-depleted cells. SULT2B was undetectable in nearly all CRPC metastases from 50 autopsy cases. Primary tumors showed variable and Gleason score (GS)-independent SULT2B levels. CRPC metastases lacking SULT2B expressed AKR1C3. Since AKR1C3 is frequently elevated in advanced prostate cancer, the inhibitory influence of SULT2B on AKR1C3 upregulation, ERK1/2 activation, EMT-like induction, and on cell motility and invasiveness may be clinically significant. Pathways regulating the inhibitory SULT2B-AKR1C3 axis may inform new avenue(s) for targeting SULT2B-deficient prostate cancer."

Using mass cytometry, we profiled these cells in Europeans and Indonesians not exposed to helminths and in Indonesians residing in rural areas infected with soil-transmitted helminths. To assign immune alteration to helminth infection, the profiling was performed before and 1 year after deworming. Very distinct signatures were found in Europeans and Indonesians, showing expanded frequencies of T helper 2 cells, particularly CD161+ cells and ILC2s in helminth-infected Indonesians, which was confirmed functionally through analysis of cytokine-producing cells. Besides ILC2s and CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and γδ T cells in Indonesians produced type 2 cytokines. Regulatory T cells were also expanded in Indonesians, but only those expressing CTLA-4, and some coexpressed CD38, HLA-DR, ICOS, or CD161. CD11c+ B cells were found to be the main IL-10 producers among B cells in Indonesians, a subset that was almost absent in Europeans. A number of the distinct immune profiles were driven by helminths as the profiles reverted after clearance of helminth infections. Moreover, Indonesians with no helminth infections residing in an urban area showed immune profiles that resembled Europeans rather than rural Indonesians, which excludes a major role for ethnicity. Detailed insight into the human type 2 and regulatory networks could provide opportunities to target these cells for more precise interventions."

For more than two decades, peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) tetramers and flow cytometry have been the gold standard for detection of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells specific to antigens in the context of MHC class I and class II, respectively. Nonetheless, more recent studies combining such reagents with mass cytometry, that is, cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF), have offered far more comprehensive profiling of antigen-specific T-cell responses. In addition, mass cytometry has enabled ex vivo screening of CD8+ T-cell reactivities against hundreds of MHC class I restricted candidate epitopes. MHC class II molecules, on the other hand, have been challenging to combine with mass cytometry as they are more complex and bind with lower affinities to cognate T-cell receptors than MHC class I molecules. In this review, I discuss how techniques originally developed to improve the staining capacity of pMHC tetramers in flow cytometry led to the successful combination of such reagents with mass cytometry. Especially, I will highlight very recent advances facilitating the combination with pMHC class II tetramers. Together, these mass cytometry-based studies can help develop more targeted treatments for cancer and autoimmune disorders."

Cytofast takes into account the phenotypic characterization of cell clusters, calculates the cell cluster abundance, then quantitatively compares groups. This protocol explains the applications of Cytofast to the use of mass cytometry data based on modulation of the immune system in the tumor microenvironment (i.e., the natural killer [NK] cell response) upon tumor challenge followed by immunotherapy (PD-L1 blockade). Demonstration of the usefulness of Cytofast with FlowSOM and Cytosplore is shown. Cytofast rapidly generates visual representations of group-related immune cell clusters and correlations with immune system composition. Differences are observed in the clustering analysis, but separation between groups are visible with both clustering methods. Cytofast visually shows the patterns induced by PD-L1 treatment that include a higher abundance of activated NK cell subsets, expressing a higher intensity of activation markers (i.e., CD54 or CD11c)."

Expression of several B-cell markers were significantly different in ACPA+ RA compared to healthy controls, including an increase in HLA-DR across subsets, CD22 in clusters of IgM+ B cells and CD11c in IgA+ memory. Moreover, both IgA+ and IgG+ double negative (IgD- CD27-) CD11c+ B cells were increased in ACPA+ RA, and there was a trend for elevation in a CXCR5/CCR6high transitional B-cell cluster. In the RA BCR repertoire, there were significant differences in subclass distribution and, notably, the frequency of VH with low somatic hypermutation (SHM) was strikingly higher, especially in IgG1 (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, both ACPA+ and ACPA- RA patients had significantly higher total serum IgA and IgM compared to controls, based on serology of larger cohorts (n = 3494 IgA; n = 397 IgM). The observed elevated Ig-levels, distortion in IgM+ B cells, increase in double negative B cells, change in B-cell markers, and elevation of unmutated IgG+ B cells suggests defects in B-cell tolerance in RA.

Here, we addressed the multidimensional immunophenotyping of 4T1 metastatic breast cancer by the state-of-the-art single cell mass cytometry (CyTOF). We determined the dose and time dependent cytotoxicity of cisplatin on 4T1 cells by the xCelligence real-time electronic sensing assay. Cisplatin treatment reduced tumor growth, number of lung metastasis, and the splenomegaly of 4T1 tumor bearing mice. We showed that cisplatin inhibited the tumor stroma formation, the polarization of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts by the diminished proteolytic activity of fibroblast activating protein. The CyTOF analysis revealed the emergence of CD11b+/Gr-1+/CD44+ or CD11b+/Gr-1+/IL-17A+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and the absence of B220+ or CD62L+ B-cells, the CD62L+/CD4+ and CD62L+/CD8+ T-cells in the spleen of advanced cancer.

While the transcriptomic signatures of DP cells partially overlapped with those of cytotoxic and type 1 regulatory CD4 T cells, the majority of them were non-cytotoxic/Tr1 and included IL21, IL22, CD109, and CCR1. Although we observed a higher frequency of DP cells in DHF, the transcriptomic profile of DP cells was similar in DF and DHF, suggesting that DHF is not associated with the altered phenotypic or functional attributes of DP cells. Overall, this study revealed a DENV-specific DP cell subset in patients with acute dengue disease and argues against altered DP cells as a determinant of DHF."

To garner an insight into tumor-specific immunomodulatory targets, we analyzed 94 patients representing five different cancer types, including those that respond relatively well to immune checkpoint therapy and those that do not, such as glioblastoma multiforme, prostate cancer and colorectal cancer. Through mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified a unique population of CD73hi macrophages in glioblastoma multiforme that persists after anti-PD-1 treatment. To test if targeting CD73 would be important for a successful combination strategy in glioblastoma multiforme, we performed reverse translational studies using CD73-/- mice. We found that the absence of CD73 improved survival in a murine model of glioblastoma multiforme treated with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1.

Conversely, the percentage of CD25+FOXP3+ CD4+ T cells was significantly (P = 0.034) higher in nonresponders. We developed a formula, which demonstrated 85.7% sensitivity and 100% specificity, based on the percentages of CD62Llow CD4+ T cells and CD25+FOXP3+ cells to predict nonresponders.

Gene expression analysis revealed that CCL19, CLEC-2A, IFNA, IL7, TGFBR3, CXCR3, and HDAC9 were preferentially expressed in CD62Llow CD4+ T cells derived from responders. Notably, long-term responders, who had >500-day progression-free survival, showed significantly higher numbers of CD62Llow CD4+ T cells prior to PD-1 blockade therapy. Decreased CD62Llow CD4+ T-cell percentages after therapy resulted in acquired resistance, with long-term survivors maintaining high CD62Llow CD4+ T-cell percentages.

Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) blockade therapy is less effective against BTCs, necessitating further studies to understand the detailed immunological status of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in BTC. Here, we examined the immunological status of the TME in 37 BTCs with early- to late-stage disease, especially focusing on PD-1+CD8+ T cells. PD-1+CD8+ T cells, which are reportedly associated with the clinical response to PD-1 blockade therapy, were frequently observed in early-stage BTC and decreased with disease progression. Imaging mass cytometry for representative PD-1+CD8+TIL-high and -low patients demonstrated that tumor-infiltrating PD-1+CD8+ T cells were localized adjacent to tumor cells, whereas PD-1-CD8+ T cells were detected mainly in the stroma of the TME. In a mouse model, PD-1 expression by tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells was higher in smaller tumors and decreased with tumor growth. Consequently, large tumors became resistant to PD-1 blockade, while small tumors containing higher numbers of PD-1+CD8+ T cells were sensitive. We propose the important role of tumor-infiltrating PD-1+CD8+ T cells in anti-tumor immunity and the potential application of PD-1 blockade therapy for early-stage BTC."

Although many studies have aimed to characterize the immune response to anti-PD-1 therapy in the tumor and in the peripheral blood, relatively less is known about the changes in the tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs). TDLNs are primary sites of tumor antigen exposure that are critical to both regulation and cross-priming of the antitumor immune response. We used multipanel mass cytometry to obtain a high-parameter proteomic (39 total unique markers) immune profile of the TDLNs in a well-studied PD-1-responsive, immunocompetent mouse model. Based on combined hierarchal gating and unsupervised clustering analyses, we found that anti-PD-1 therapy enhances remodeling of both B and T cell compartments toward memory phenotypes. Functionally, expression of checkpoint markers was increased in conjunction with production of IFN-γ, TNF-α, or IL-2 in key cell types, including B and T cell subtypes, and rarer subsets, such as Tregs and NKT cells. A deeper profiling of the immunologic changes that occur in the TDLN milieu during effective anti-PD-1 therapy may lead to the discovery of novel biomarkers for monitoring response and provide key insights toward developing combination immunotherapeutic strategies."

We created High-throughput Population Profiler (HiPPO), a tool that reduces the complexity of the CyTOF data and allows homogeneous clusters of cells to be visualized in an intuitive manner. Each subpopulation is mapped to the Population Analysis Database (PANDA), an open-source, manually curated database containing protein expression profiles for selected markers of primary cells, allowing for cell type abundance in the analyzed samples to be monitored. Custom cell definitions can be submitted for targeted identifications. All cell clusters, regardless of their annotation status, are available for further analyses. HiPPO also conducts nonparametric tests to determine whether differences in protein expression levels between conditions are significant.

Although GCN2 is a putative therapeutic target for immuno-oncology, its role in shaping the immune response to tumors is poorly understood. Here, we used mass cytometry, transcriptomics, and transcription factor-binding analysis to determine the functional impact of GCN2 on the myeloid phenotype and immune responses in melanoma. We found that myeloid-lineage deletion of GCN2 drives a shift in the phenotype of tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that promotes antitumor immunity. Time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) and single-cell RNA sequencing showed that this was due to changes in the immune microenvironment with increased proinflammatory activation of macrophages and MDSCs and interferon-γ expression in intratumoral CD8+ T cells. Mechanistically, GCN2 altered myeloid function by promoting increased translation of the transcription factor CREB-2/ATF4, which was required for maturation and polarization of macrophages and MDSCs in both mice and humans, whereas targeting Atf4 by small interfering RNA knockdown reduced tumor growth. Last, analysis of patients with cutaneous melanoma showed that GCN2-dependent transcriptional signatures correlated with macrophage polarization, T cell infiltrates, and overall survival. Thus, these data reveal a previously unknown dependence of tumors on myeloid GCN2 signals for protection from immune attack."

These studies also provide insights into the interactions of immune cell populations with neighbouring epithelial and endothelial cells in health, and across a range of kidney diseases and cancer. These data have translational potential and will aid the identification of drug targets and enable better prediction of off-target effects. The application of single-cell technologies to clinical renal biopsy samples, or even cells within urine, will improve diagnostic accuracy and assist with personalized prognostication for patients with various kidney diseases. A comparison of immune cell types in peripheral blood and secondary lymphoid organs in healthy individuals and in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases that affect the kidney will also help to unravel the mechanisms that underpin the breakdown in self-tolerance and propagation of autoimmune responses. Together, these immune cell atlases have the potential to transform nephrology."

Cutaneous lupus lesions of PD-1H KO mice have clustering of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) similar to human DLE. Using mass cytometry, we identified proinflammatory neutrophils as critical early immune infiltrating cells within cutaneous lupus lesions of PD-1H KO mice. We also found that PD-1H is highly expressed on immune cells in human SLE, DLE lesions, and cutaneous lesions of MRL/lpr mice. A PD-1H agonistic monoclonal antibody in MRL/lpr mice reduces cutaneous disease, autoantibodies, inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and immune cell expansion. Furthermore, PD-1H on both T cells and myeloid cells including neutrophils and pDCs could transmit inhibitory signals, resulting in reduced activation and function, establishing PD-1H as an inhibitory receptor on T cells and myeloid cells. On the basis of these findings, we propose that PD-1H is a critical element in the pathogenesis and progression of lupus, and PD-1H activation could be effective for treatment of systemic and cutaneous lupus."

Regulation of these functions remains poorly understood but could be mediated by functionally specialized pDC subpopulations. We address pDC diversity using a high-dimensional single-cell approach: mass cytometry (CyTOF). Our analysis uncovers a murine pDC-like population that specializes in antigen presentation with limited capacity for IFN-I production. Using a multifaceted cross-species comparison, we show that this pDC-like population is the definitive murine equivalent of the recently described human AXL+ DCs, which we unify under the name transitional DCs (tDCs) given their continuum of pDC and cDC2 characteristics. tDCs share developmental traits with pDCs, as well as recruitment dynamics during viral infection. Altogether, we provide a framework for deciphering the function of pDCs and tDCs during diseases, which has the potential to open new avenues for therapeutic design."

This dysregulation likely contributes to tip the balance toward viral persistence. Different DC subpopulations, including classical (cDCs) and plasmacytoid (pDCs) dendritic cells, are subjected to concomitant inflammatory and immunoregulatory events during HIV infection, which hampers the precise characterization of their regulation through classical approaches. Here, we carried out mass cytometry analysis of blood samples from early HIV-infected patients that were longitudinally collected before and after 1 year of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Blood samples from HIV controller patients who naturally control the infection were also included. Our data revealed that plasma HIV RNA level was positively associated with a loss of cDC and pDC subpopulations that display high expression of LILR immunomodulatory receptors. Conversely, specific monocyte populations co-expressing high levels of HLA-I, 3 immunomodulatory receptors, CD64, LILRA2, and LILRB4, and the restriction factor CD317 (also known as BST2/Tetherin), were more abundant in early HIV-infection. Finally, our analysis revealed that the blood of HIV controller patients contained in a higher abundance a particular subtype of CD1c+ cDCs, characterized by elevated co-expression of CD32b inhibitory receptor and HLA-DR antigen-presentation molecules. Overall, this study unravels the modifications induced in DC and monocyte subpopulations in different HIV+ conditions, and provides a better comprehension of the immune regulation/dysregulation mechanisms induced during this viral infection."

To understand the effect of NK diversity during immune recovery on the antitumor response after cord blood transplantation (CBT), we used high-dimensional mass cytometry and the metrics of NK cell diversity to study the NK cell repertoire in serial samples from 43 CBT recipients. A higher-diversity index based on single-cell combinatorial phenotypes was significantly associated with a lower risk for relapse after CBT (P = .005). Cytomegalovirus reactivation was a major factor in the development of a more diverse NK repertoire after CBT. Notably, we identified a group of patients whose CB-derived NK cells after transplantation possessed an immature phenotype (CB-NKim), characterized by poor effector function and a low diversity index. Frequencies of CB-NKim of 11.8% or higher during the early post-CBT recovery phase were highly predictive for relapse (area under the curve [AUC], 0.979), a finding that was validated in a second independent cohort of patients (n = 25; AUC, 0.977). Moreover, we showed that the maturation, diversity, and acquisition of effector function by CB-NKim early after CBT were driven by interleukin 15. Our data indicate that the diversity of the NK cell repertoire after CBT contributes importantly to the risk for subsequent relapse. We suggest that the use of diversity metrics and high-dimensional mass cytometry may be useful tools in predicting clinical outcomes and informing the design of therapeutic strategies to prevent relapse after CBT."

It is not clear what drives this differential progression rate. CD8+ T cells have been implicated in the autoimmune destruction of β cells. Here, we addressed whether the phenotype and function of autoreactive CD8+ T cells influence disease progression. We identified islet-specific CD8+ T cells using high-content, single-cell mass cytometry in combination with peptide-loaded MHC tetramer staining. We applied a new analytical method, DISCOV-R, to characterize these rare subsets. Autoreactive T cells were phenotypically heterogeneous, and their phenotype differed by rate of disease progression. Activated islet-specific CD8+ memory T cells were prevalent in subjects with T1D who experienced rapid loss of C-peptide; in contrast, slow disease progression was associated with an exhaustion-like profile, with expression of multiple inhibitory receptors, limited cytokine production, and reduced proliferative capacity. This relationship between properties of autoreactive CD8+ T cells and the rate of T1D disease progression after onset make these phenotypes attractive putative biomarkers of disease trajectory and treatment response and reveal potential targets for therapeutic intervention."

The current generation of commercially available beads carries four lanthanide elements (cerium, europium, holmium, and lutetium). However, this is not sufficient to calibrate the full span of detection channels, ranging from yttrium (89 amu) to bismuth (209 amu), which are now available. To address this issue we prepared polystyrene microbeads encoded with seven elements (yttrium, indium, and bismuth in addition to the four lanthanides) by multistage dispersion polymerization for MC calibration and normalization. The bead synthesis conditions were optimized to obtain microbeads that were uniform in size and generated strong MC signal intensities at similar levels for the eight encoded isotopes. Metal ion leaching from the beads under storage and application conditions was also examined. We demonstrated that the precision of normalized MC signals in the MC detection channels was improved by employing seven-element-encoded microbeads as a standard."

Platinum compounds cause DNA damage and induce apoptotic cell death in the bulk tumor population. However, subpopulations of tumor cells may exhibit diverging behaviors from the bulk tumor due to an alternate stress response that diverts tumor cells from apoptotic death. In this study, we identified a salvage survival pathway in which G2-arrested tumor cells bypassed apoptosis and progressed through aberrant mitotic events to then emerge as a distinct subpopulation of viable large hyperploid cells but with uncertain long-term propagation potential. Platinum-induced large hyperploid cells were flow sorted and showed rare regrowth capacity as compared to their more proficiently regenerating non-hyperploid counterparts. However, detailed time-lapse microscopy provided direct evidence that these hyperploid cells were mitotically active and could divide successfully to produce viable daughter cells. The hyperploid survival response was observed across different cell lines and utilization of this survival pathway was dependent on the strength of the G2-M checkpoint. Conceivably, this salvage survival strategy may contribute to increased genomic diversity of the regenerating tumor cell line through a coupled hyperploidization and de-polyploidization process that may be relevant for drug resistance."

Tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDCs) generated from monocytes by a combined treatment with vitamin D and dexamethasone (marked by CD52hi and CD86lo expression) induce antigen-specific Tregs. We evaluated the phenotypes of these Tregs using high-dimensional mass cytometry to identify a surface-based T cell signature of tolerogenic modulation. Naïve CD4+ T cells were stimulated with tolDCs or mature inflammatory DCs pulsed with proinsulin peptide, after which the suppressive capacity, cytokine production and phenotype of stimulated T cells were analysed. TolDCs induced suppressive T cell lines that were dominated by a naïve phenotype (CD45RA+CCR7+). These naïve T cells, however, did not show suppressive capacity, but were arrested in their naïve status. T cell cultures stimulated by tolDC further contained memory-like (CD45RA-CCR7-) T cells expressing regulatory markers Lag-3, CD161 and ICOS. T cells expressing CD25lo or CD25hi were most prominent and suppressed CD4+ proliferation, while CD25hi Tregs also effectively supressed effector CD8+ T cells. We conclude that tolDCs induce antigen-specific Tregs with various phenotypes. This extends our earlier findings pointing to a functionally diverse pool of antigen-induced and specific Tregs and provides the basis for immune-monitoring in clinical trials with tolDC."

In this study, seven sites received whole blood and six sites received PBMC samples from single donors over a 2-week interval. Each site labeled replicate samples and acquired data on Helios™ instruments using an assay-specific acquisition template. All acquired sample files were then automatically analyzed by Maxpar Pathsetter™ software. A cleanup step eliminated debris, dead cells, aggregates, and normalization beads. The second step automatically enumerated 37 immune cell populations and performed label intensity assessments on all 30 markers. The inter-site reproducibility of the 37 quantified cell populations had consistent population frequencies, with an average %CV of 14.4% for whole blood and 17.7% for PBMC. The dry reagent coupled with automated data analysis is not only convenient but also provides a high degree of reproducibility within and among multiple test sites resulting in a comprehensive yet practical solution for deep immune phenotyping."

Using mass cytometry and a highly multiplexed peptide-HLA (human leukocyte antigen) tetramer staining strategy, we probed T cells from dengue patients-a total of 430 dengue and control candidate epitopes-together with key markers of activation, trafficking, and differentiation. During acute disease, dengue-specific CD8+ T cells expressed a distinct profile of activation and trafficking receptors that distinguished them from non-dengue-specific T cells. During convalescence, dengue-specific T cells differentiated into two major cell fates, CD57+ CD127--resembling terminally differentiated senescent memory cells and CD127+ CD57--resembling proliferation-capable memory cells. Validation in an independent cohort showed that these subsets remained at elevated frequencies up to one year after infection. These analyses aid our understanding of the generation of T cell memory in dengue infection or vaccination."

Patients with advanced stages of colorectal cancer will all undergo treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy which may alter the complexity of immune cell populations. This study used mass cytometry to investigate the circulating immune cell profile of advanced CRC patients following acute and chronic doses of standard cytotoxic chemotherapy and analysed seven major immune cell populations and over 20 subpopulations. Unsupervised clustering analysis of the mass cytometry data revealed a decrease in NK cells following one cycle of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Investigation into the NK sub-population revealed a decline in the CD56dim CD16+ NK cell population following acute and chronic chemotherapy treatment. Further analysis into the frequency of the NK cell sub-populations during the long-term chemotherapy treatment revealed a shift in the sub-populations, with a decrease in the mature, cytotoxic CD56dim CD16+ accompanied by a significant increase in the less mature CD56dim CD16- and CD56bright NK cell populations. Furthermore, analysis of the phosphorylation status of signalling responses in the NK cells found significant differences in pERK, pP38, pSTAT3, and pSTAT5 between the patients and healthy volunteers and remained unchanged throughout the chemotherapy. Results from this study reveals that there is a sustained decrease in the mature CD16+ NK cell sub-population frequency following long-term chemotherapy which may have clinical implications in therapeutic decision making."

Both DC and Mo can be phenotypically divided into subsets. DC are divided into plasmacytoid DC, which are CD11c- , CD304+ , CD85g+ , and myeloid DC that are CD11c+ . The CD11c+ DC are readily classified as CD1c+ DC and CD141+ DC. Monocytes are broadly divided into the CD14+ CD16- (classical) and CD14dim CD16+ subsets (nonclassical). A population of myeloid-derived cells that have DC characteristics, that is, HLA-DR+ and lacking lineage markers including CD14, but express CD16 are generally clustered with CD14dim CD16+ monocytes. We used high-dimensional clustering analyses of fluorescence and mass cytometry data, to delineate CD14+ monocytes, CD14dim CD16+ monocytes (CD16+ Mo), and CD14- CD16+ DC (CD16+ DC). We sought to identify the functional and kinetic relationship of CD16+ DC to CD16+ Mo. We demonstrate that differentiation of CD16+ DC and CD16+ Mo during activation with IFNγ in vitro and as a result of an allo-hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) in vivo resulted in distinct populations. Recovery of blood CD16+ DC in both auto- and allo-(HCT) patients after myeloablative conditioning showed similar reconstitution and activation kinetics to CD16+ Mo. Finally, we show that expression of the cell surface markers CD300c, CCR5, and CLEC5a can distinguish the cell populations phenotypically paving the way for functional differentiation as new reagents become available."

Radioresistance represents a major source of treatment failure, underlining the urgent necessity to explore and implement effective radiosensitization strategies. The MET receptor widely participates in the acquisition and maintenance of an aggressive phenotype in HNSCC and modulates the DNA damage response following ionizing radiation (IR). Here, we assessed MET expression and mutation status in primary and metastatic lesions within a cohort of patients with advanced HNSCC. Moreover, we investigated the radiosensitization potential of the MET inhibitor tepotinib in a panel of cell lines, in vitro and in vivo, as well as in ex vivo patient-derived organotypic tissue cultures (OTC). MET was highly expressed in 62.4% of primary tumors and in 53.6% of lymph node metastases (LNM), and in 6 of 9 evaluated cell lines. MET expression in primaries and LNMs was significantly associated with decreased disease control in univariate survival analyses. Tepotinib abrogated MET phosphorylation and to distinct extent MET downstream signaling. Pretreatment with tepotinib resulted in variable radiosensitization, enhanced DNA damage, cell death, and G2-M-phase arrest. Combination of tepotinib with IR led to significant radiosensitization in one of two tested in vivo models. OTCs revealed differential patterns of response toward tepotinib, irradiation, and combination of both modalities. The molecular basis of tepotinib-mediated radiosensitization was studied by a CyTOF-based single-cell mass cytometry approach, which uncovered that MET inhibition modulated PI3K activity in cells radiosensitized by tepotinib but not in the resistant ones."

We recently demonstrated the use of l-2-tellurienylalanine (TePhe), a mimic of phenylalanine (Phe), as an MC- and IMC-compatible protein synthesis reporter. In this work, the biochemical similarity of TePhe and its cognate analogue, Phe, are examined in the context of the RNase S complex. Isothermal titration calorimetry studies show that incorporation of TePhe preserves the interaction of S-peptide with S-protein, and the dissociation constants for the interaction of the Phe and TePhe peptides are within a factor of two. The resulting RNase S complex is catalytically active without significant alterations in the enzyme's kinetic parameters. Furthermore, circular dichroism spectroscopy does not reveal any changes to the secondary structure of TePhe-substituted RNase S. These findings provide strong evidence that TePhe functions as a Phe isostere in the context of a folded protein. It is anticipated that incorporation of TePhe into peptides or peptidomimetic scaffolds will enable facile generation of MC and IMCTM probes."

The complexity and volume of data generated by this platform have accelerated the creation of novel methods for high-dimensional data analysis and visualization. A key step in any high-level data analysis is the removal of unwanted events, a process often referred to as data cleanup. Data cleanup as applied to mass cytometry typically focuses on elimination of dead cells, debris, normalization beads, true aggregates, and coincident ion clouds from raw data. We describe a probability state modeling (PSM) method that automatically identifies and removes these elements, resulting in FCS files that contain mostly live and intact events. This approach not only leverages QC measurements such as DNA, live/dead, and event length but also four additional pulse-processing parameters that are available on Fluidigm Helios™ and CyTOF® (Fluidigm, Markham, Canada) 2 instruments with software versions of 6.3 or higher. These extra Gaussian-derived parameters are valuable for detecting well-formed pulses and eliminating coincident positive ion clouds. The automated nature of this new routine avoids the subjectivity of other gating methods and results in unbiased elimination of unwanted events. © 2019 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry."

Until recently, high-dimensional cellular analyses implied the loss of tissue context as they were mostly performed in single-cell suspensions. The advent of imaging mass cytometry introduced the possibility to simultaneously detect a multitude of cellular markers in tissue sections. This technique can be applied to various tissue sources including snap-frozen and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. However, a number of methodological challenges must be overcome when developing large antibody panels in order to preserve signal intensity and specificity of antigen detection. We report the development of a 40-marker panel for imaging mass cytometry on FFPE tissues with a particular focus on the study of cancer immune microenvironments. It comprises a variety of immune cell markers including lineage and activation markers as well as surrogates of cancer cell states and tissue-specific markers (e.g., stroma, epithelium, vessels) for cellular contextualization within the tissue. Importantly, we developed an optimized workflow for maximum antibody performance by separating antibodies into two distinct incubation steps, at different temperatures and incubation times, shown to significantly improve immunodetection. Furthermore, we provide insight into the antibody validation process and discuss why some antibodies and/or cellular markers are not compatible with the technique. This work is aimed at supporting the implementation of imaging mass cytometry in other laboratories by describing methodological procedures in detail. Furthermore, the panel described here is an excellent immune monitoring tool that can be readily applied in the context of cancer research."

Conventional bulk measurement by averaging the biological responses across a population often loses the information of cellular variations. Single-cell proteomic technologies are becoming increasingly important to understand and discern cellular heterogeneity. The well-established methods for single-cell protein analysis based on flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy are limited by the low multiplexing ability owing to the spectra overlap of fluorophores for labeling antibodies. Recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS), microchip, and reiterative staining-based techniques for single-cell proteomics have enabled the evaluation of cellular heterogeneity with high throughput, increased multiplexity, and improved sensitivity. In this review, the principles, developments, advantages, and limitations of these advanced technologies in analysis of single-cell proteins, along with their biological applications to study cellular heterogeneity, are described. At last, the remaining challenges, possible strategies, and future opportunities that will facilitate the improvement and broad applications of single-cell proteomic technologies in cell biology and medical research are discussed."

We completed a deep mapping of the immune system in adults with DS using mass cytometry to evaluate 100 immune cell types, which revealed global immune dysregulation consistent with chronic inflammation, including key changes in the myeloid and lymphoid cell compartments. Furthermore, measurement of interferon-inducible phosphorylation events revealed widespread hypersensitivity to interferon-α in DS, with cell-type-specific variations in downstream intracellular signaling. Mechanistically, this could be explained by overexpression of the interferon receptors encoded on chromosome 21, as demonstrated by increased IFNAR1 surface expression in all immune lineages tested. These results point to interferon-driven immune dysregulation as a likely contributor to the developmental and clinical hallmarks of DS."

We investigated the effects of TNF-blockade on CD4+ T cell activation, maturation, and proliferation, and assessed whether TNF-inhibitors confer regulatory potential to CD4+ T cells. CyTOF and flow cytometry analysis revealed that in vitro treatment of human CD4+ T cells with the anti-TNF monoclonal antibody adalimumab promoted IL-10 expression in CD4+ T cells, whilst decreasing cellular activation. In line with this, analysis of gene expression profiling datasets of anti-TNF-treated IL-17 or IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells revealed changes in multiple pathways associated with cell cycle and proliferation. Kinetics experiments showed that anti-TNF treatment led to delayed, rather than impaired T-cell activation and maturation. Whilst anti-TNF-treated CD4+ T cells displayed some hyporesponsiveness upon restimulation, they did not acquire enhanced capacity to suppress T-cell responses or modulate monocyte phenotype. These cells however displayed a reduced ability to induce IL-6 and IL-8 production by synovial fibroblasts. Together, these data indicate that anti-TNF treatment delays human CD4+ T-cell activation, maturation, and proliferation, and this reduced activation state may impair their ability to activate stromal cells."

NK cells from pregnant women displayed significantly increased expression of several functional and activation markers such as CD38 on both subsets and NKp46 on CD56dim NK cells. NK cells also displayed diminished expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 during pregnancy. Overall, these data demonstrate that functional and phenotypic shifts occur in NK cells during pregnancy that can influence the magnitude of the immune response to both infections and tumors."

This fractional killing is linked to cellular variation that bulk assays cannot capture. Here, we quantify the diversity in cellular signaling responses to TRAIL, linking it to apoptotic frequency across numerous cell systems with single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF). Although all cells respond to TRAIL, a variable fraction persists without apoptotic progression. This cell-specific behavior is nonheritable where both the TRAIL-induced signaling responses and frequency of apoptotic resistance remain unaffected by prior exposure. The diversity of signaling states upon exposure is correlated to TRAIL resistance. Concomitantly, constricting the variation in signaling response with kinase inhibitors proportionally decreases TRAIL resistance. Simultaneously, TRAIL-induced de novo translation in resistant cells, when blocked by cycloheximide, abrogated all TRAIL resistance. This work highlights how cell signaling diversity, and subsequent translation response, relates to nonheritable fractional escape from TRAIL-induced apoptosis. This refined view of TRAIL resistance provides new avenues to study death ligands in general."

However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms driving this phenotype remain unclear. Building upon our previous finding that T cells from people with DS show increased expression of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes, we have completed a comprehensive characterization of the peripheral T cell compartment in adults with DS with and without autoimmune conditions. CD8+ T cells from adults with DS are depleted of naïve subsets and enriched for differentiated subsets, express higher levels of markers of activation and senescence (e.g., IFN-γ, Granzyme B, PD-1, KLRG1), and overproduce cytokines tied to autoimmunity (e.g., TNF-α). Conventional CD4+ T cells display increased differentiation, polarization toward the Th1 and Th1/17 states, and overproduction of the autoimmunity-related cytokines IL-17A and IL-22. Plasma cytokine analysis confirms elevation of multiple autoimmunity-related cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL17A-D, IL-22) in people with DS, independent of diagnosis of autoimmunity. Although Tregs are more abundant in DS, functional assays show that CD8+ and CD4+ effector T cells with T21 are resistant to Treg-mediated suppression, regardless of Treg karyotype. Transcriptome analysis of white blood cells and T cells reveals strong signatures of T cell differentiation and activation that correlate positively with IFN hyperactivity. Finally, mass cytometry analysis of 8 IFN-inducible phosphoepitopes demonstrates that T cell subsets with T21 show elevated levels of basal IFN signaling and hypersensitivity to IFN-α stimulation. Therefore, these results point to T cell dysregulation associated with IFN hyperactivity as a contributor to autoimmunity in DS."

Already, there exists a large pool of advanced high-dimensional analysis algorithms that explore the observed heterogeneous distributions making intriguing biological inferences. A fact largely overlooked by these methods, however, is the effect of the established data preprocessing pipeline to the distributions of the measured quantities. In this article, we focus on randomization, a transformation used for improving data visualization, which can negatively affect multivariate data analysis methods such as dimensionality reduction, clustering, and network reconstruction algorithms. Our results indicate that randomization should be used only for visualization purposes, but not in conjunction with high-dimensional analytical tools. © 2019 The Authors.

Epub 2019 Oct 25.,Keywords: Autologous transplantation; Mesoangioblast cells; Muscle dystrophies; Myogenic differentiation; Stem cell fate.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal muscle-wasting disease caused by the lack of dystrophin in muscle fibers that is currently without curative treatment. Mesoangioblasts (MABs) are multipotent progenitor cells that can differentiate to a myogenic lineage and that can be used to express Dystrophin upon transplantation into muscles, in autologous gene therapy approaches. However, their fate in the muscle environment remains poorly characterized. Here, we investigated the differentiation fate of MABs following their transplantation in DMD murine muscles using a mass cytometry strategy. This allowed the identification and isolation of a fraction of MAB-derived cells presenting common properties with satellite muscle stem cells. This analysis also indicated that most cells did not undergo a myogenic differentiation path once in the muscle environment, limiting their capacity to restore dystrophin expression in transplanted muscles. We therefore assessed whether MAB treatment with cytokines and growth factors prior to engraftment may improve their myogenic fate. We identified a combination of such signals that ameliorates MABs capacity to undergo myogenic differentiation in vivo and to restore dystrophin expression upon engraftment in myopathic murine muscles."

The pathophysiology of the disease is complex, involving both adaptive and innate immunity. Among innate immune cells, neutrophils have been rarely studied due to their sensitivity to freezing and they are not being collected after Ficoll purification. Methods: We used mass cytometry to perform a multidimensional phenotypic characterization of immune cells from RA-treated patients, which included the simultaneous study of 33 intra- or extra-cellular markers expressed by leukocytes. We were able to focus our study on innate immune cells, especially neutrophils, due to a specific fixation method before freezing. In addition, blood samples were stimulated or not with various TLR agonists to evaluate whether RA-dependent chronic inflammation can lead to immune-cell exhaustion. Results: We show that RA induces the presence of CD11blow neutrophils (33.7 and 9.2% of neutrophils in RA and controls, respectively) associated with the duration of disease. This subpopulation additionally exhibited heterogeneous expression of CD16. We also characterized a CD11ahigh Granzyme Bhigh T-cell subpopulation possibly associated with disease activity. There was no difference in cytokine expression after the stimulation of immune cells by TLR agonists between RA and controls. Conclusion: Mass cytometry and our fixation method allowed us to identify two potential new blood subpopulations of neutrophils and T-cells, which could be involved in RA pathology. The phenotypes of these two potential new subpopulations need to be confirmed using other experimental approaches, and the exact role of these subpopulations is yet to be studied."

A barcoding approach allows for 20 unique samples to be pooled and processed together in one tube, reducing the intra-barcode technical variability. However, with only 20 samples per barcode, multiple barcode sets (batches) are required to address questions in robustly powered study designs. A batch adjustment procedure is required to reduce variability across batches and to facilitate direct comparison of runs performed across multiple barcodes run over weeks, months, or years. We describe a method using technical replicates that are included in each run to determine and apply an appropriate adjustment per batch without manual intervention. The use of technical replicate samples (i.e., anchors or reference samples) avoids assumptions of sample homogeneity among batches, and allows direct estimation of batch effects and appropriate adjustment parameters applicable to all samples within a batch. Quantification of cell subpopulations and mean signal intensity pre- and post-adjustment using both manual gating and unsupervised clustering demonstrate substantial mitigation of batch effects in the anchor samples used for this adjustment calculation, and in a second validation set of technical replicates."

By measuring nuclear bomb test-derived 14C in genomic DNA, we determined the turnover rates of CD4+ and CD8+ naive T-cell populations and defined their dynamics in healthy individuals ranging from 20 to 65 years of age. We demonstrate that naive T-cell generation decreases with age because of a combination of declining peripheral division and thymic production during adulthood. Concomitant decline in T-cell loss compensates for decreased generation rates. We investigated putative mechanisms underlying age-related changes in homeostatic regulation of CD4+ naive T-cell turnover, using mass cytometry to profile candidate signaling pathways involved in T-cell activation and proliferation relative to CD31 expression, a marker of thymic proximity for the CD4+ naive T-cell population. We show that basal nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) phosphorylation positively correlated with CD31 expression and thus is decreased in peripherally expanded naive T-cell clones. Functionally, we found that NF-κB signaling was essential for naive T-cell proliferation to the homeostatic growth factor interleukin (IL)-7, and reduced NF-κB phosphorylation in CD4+CD31- naive T cells is linked to reduced homeostatic proliferation potential. Our results reveal an age-related decline in naive T-cell turnover as a putative regulator of naive T-cell diversity and identify a molecular pathway that restricts proliferation of peripherally expanded naive T-cell clones that accumulate with age."

Epub 2019 Oct 23.,Keywords: IL-38; ILC2s; Tregs; allergic asthma; eosinophils.,"We elucidated the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of IL-38 in allergic asthma. Human bronchial epithelial cells and eosinophils were cocultured upon stimulation with the viral RLR ligand poly (I:C)/LyoVec or infection-related cytokine TNF-α to induce expression of cytokines/chemokines/adhesion molecules. House dust mite (HDM)-induced allergic asthma and humanized allergic asthma NOD/SCID murine models were established to assess anti-inflammatory mechanisms in vivo. IL-38 significantly inhibited induced proinflammatory IL-6, IL-1β, CCL5, and CXCL10 production, and antiviral interferon-β and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression in the coculture system. Mass cytometry and RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that IL-38 could antagonize the activation of the intracellular STAT1, STAT3, p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, and NF-κB pathways, and upregulate the expression of the host defense-related gene POU2AF1 and anti-allergic response gene RGS13. Intraperitoneal injection of IL-38 into HDM-induced allergic asthma mice could ameliorate airway hyperreactivity by decreasing the accumulation of eosinophils in the lungs and inhibiting the expression of the Th2-related cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung homogenates. Histological examination indicated lung inflammation was alleviated by reductions in cell infiltration and goblet cell hyperplasia, together with reduced Th2, Th17, and innate lymphoid type 2 cell numbers but increased proportions of regulatory T cells in the lungs, spleen, and lymph nodes. IL-38 administration suppressed airway hyperreactivity and asthma-related IL-4 and IL-5 expression in humanized mice, together with significantly decreased CCR3+ eosinophil numbers in the BALF and lungs, and a reduced percentage of human CD4+CRTH2+ Th2 cells in the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes. Together, our results demonstrated the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of IL-38 and provided a basis for the development of a regulatory cytokine-based treatment for allergic asthma."

Patient outcomes can be predicted by cell-of-origin (COO) classification, demonstrating that the underlying transcriptional signature of malignant B-cells informs biological behavior in the context of standard combination chemotherapy regimens. In the current study, we used mass cytometry (CyTOF) to examine tumor phenotypes at the protein level with single cell resolution in a collection of 27 diagnostic DLBCL biopsy specimens from treatment naïve patients. We found that malignant B-cells from each patient occupied unique regions in 37-dimensional phenotypic space with no apparent clustering of samples into discrete subtypes. Interestingly, variable MHC class II expression was found to be the greatest contributor to phenotypic diversity. Within individual tumors, a subset of cases showed multiple phenotypic subpopulations, and in one case, we were able to demonstrate direct correspondence between protein-level phenotypic subsets and DNA mutation-defined subclones. In summary, CyTOF analysis can resolve both intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity among primary samples and reveals that each case of DLBCL is unique and may be comprised of multiple, genetically distinct subclones. © 2019 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry."

We present the case of a patient with BRAF-negative stage IVC anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) treated with the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, pembrolizumab, following radiographic progression on chemoradiation. Blood samples were collected prior to and at four time points during treatment with pembrolizumab. Mass cytometry was used to determine expression of relevant biomarkers by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Faecal samples were collected at baseline and 4 weeks following treatment initiation; taxonomic profiling using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing was performed. Following treatment, a marked expansion in CD20+ B cell, CD16+ CD56lo NK cell and CD45RO+ CCR7+ central memory CD4+ T-cell populations was observed in the peripheral blood. Proportions of cells expressing the co-receptors TIGIT, OX40 and CD86 also increased during treatment. A high abundance of bacteria of the order Bacteroidales, specifically from the Bacteroidaceae and Rikenellaceae families, was identified in the faecal microbiota. Moreover, the patient's microbiome was enriched in Clostridiales order members Ruminococcaceae, Veillonellaceae and Lachnospiraceae. Alpha diversity of the gut microbiome was significantly higher following initiation of checkpoint therapy as assessed by the Shannon and Simpson index. Our results suggest that treatment with pembrolizumab promotes expansion of T-, B- and NK cell populations in the peripheral blood at the time of tumour regression and have the potential to be implemented as predictive biomarkers in the context of checkpoint blockade therapy. Larger studies to confirm these findings are warranted."

Recent advancements in multidimensional technologies, including mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing, are challenging our current understanding of cell types, cell subsets, and functional states of cells. Despite the power of these technologies to create new reference maps for the myeloid cell system, it is essential to put these new results into context with previous knowledge that was established over decades.

Combination anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 blockade therapy has enhanced efficacy, but it remains unclear through what mechanisms such effects are mediated. A critical question is whether combination therapy targets and modulates the same T cell populations as monotherapies. Using a mass cytometry-based systems approach, we comprehensively profiled the response of T cell populations to monotherapy and combination anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1 therapy in syngeneic murine tumors and clinical samples. Most effects of monotherapies were additive in the context of combination therapy; however, multiple combination therapy-specific effects were observed. Highly phenotypically exhausted cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) T cells expand in frequency following anti-PD-1 monotherapy but not combination therapy, while activated terminally differentiated effector CD8 T cells expand only following combination therapy. Combination therapy also led to further increased frequency of T helper type 1 (Th1)-like CD4 effector T cells even though anti-PD-1 monotherapy is not sufficient to do so. Mass cytometry analyses of peripheral blood from melanoma patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade therapies similarly revealed mostly additive effects on the frequencies of T cell subsets along with unique modulation of terminally differentiated effector CD8 T cells by combination ipilimumab plus nivolumab therapy. Together, these findings indicate that dual blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1 therapy is sufficient to induce unique cellular responses compared with either monotherapy."

Epub 2019 Oct 21.,Keywords: barcoding; computational cytometry; mass cytometry; normalization.,"High-dimensional flow cytometry has matured to a level that enables deep phenotyping of cellular systems at a clinical scale. The resulting high-content data sets allow characterizing the human immune system at unprecedented single cell resolution. However, the results are highly dependent on sample preparation and measurements might drift over time. While various controls exist for assessment and improvement of data quality in a single sample, the challenges of cross-sample normalization attempts have been limited to aligning marker distributions across subjects. These approaches, inspired by bulk genomics and proteomics assays, ignore the single-cell nature of the data and risk the removal of biologically relevant signals. This work proposes CytoNorm, a normalization algorithm to ensure internal consistency between clinical samples based on shared controls across various study batches. Data from the shared controls is used to learn the appropriate transformations for each batch (e.g., each analysis day). Importantly, some sources of technical variation are strongly influenced by the amount of protein expressed on specific cell types, requiring several population-specific transformations to normalize cells from a heterogeneous sample. To address this, our approach first identifies the overall cellular distribution using a clustering step, and calculates subset-specific transformations on the control samples by computing their quantile distributions and aligning them with splines. These transformations are then applied to all other clinical samples in the batch to remove the batch-specific variations. We evaluated the algorithm on a customized data set with two shared controls across batches. One control sample was used for calculation of the normalization transformations and the second control was used as a blinded test set and evaluated with Earth Mover's distance. Additional results are provided using two real-world clinical data sets. Overall, our method compared favorably to standard normalization procedures.

Whole blood preservation kits applying fixation and/or permeabilization agents are increasingly used in clinical trials to preserve leukocytes needed for downstream analysis. We here present a structured overview of leukocyte surface marker detectability in samples processed with four commercially available whole blood preservation kits; 1) Proteomic Stabilizer, 2) Stable-Lyse V2 and Stable-Store V2, 3) Cytodelics and 4) Lyse/Fix Buffer, as well as in samples treated with buffers included in Mass-tag Cellular Barcoding kits. Isolated leukocytes were stained with a 28-marker panel (including 7 chemokine receptors) of metal-conjugated antibodies and analysed on a mass cytometer. Exploration of the data by manual gating and viSNE analysis showed that although many markers were similarly detected across all sample conditions, most of the chemokine receptors in our panel, particularly CXCR3, CCR4, CCR6 and CXCR5, were incorrectly detected in the preserved samples and thus incompatible with the fixation and permeabilization agents found in whole blood preservation kits and in buffers used prior to barcoding."

Conversely, the Hygiene Hypothesis suggests that a lack of exposure to infectious agents early in life could explain the increasing incidence of allergies and autoimmunity in high-income countries. Understanding these phenomena, however, is hampered by a lack of comprehensive, direct immune monitoring in children with differing degrees of microbial exposure. Using mass cytometry, we provide an in-depth profile of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of children in regions at the extremes of exposure: the San Francisco Bay Area, USA and an economically poor district of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Despite variability in clinical health, functional characteristics of PBMCs were similar in Bangladeshi and American children at 1 year of age. However, by 2-3 years of age, Bangladeshi children's immune cells often demonstrated altered activation and cytokine production profiles upon stimulation with PMA-ionomycin, with an overall immune trajectory more in line with American adults. Conversely, immune responses in children from the US remained steady. Using principal component analysis, donor location, ethnic background, and cytomegalovirus infection status were found to account for some of the variation identified among samples. Within Bangladeshi 1-year-olds, stunting (as measured by height-for-age z-scores) was found to be associated with IL-8 and TGFβ expression in PMA-ionomycin stimulated samples. Combined, these findings provide important insights into the immune systems of children in high vs. low microbial exposure environments and suggest an important role for IL-8 and TGFβ in mitigating the microbial challenges faced by the Bangladeshi children."

Using mass cytometry (CyTOF) and next-generation sequencing of B and T cell receptor (BCR and TCR) repertoires, we demonstrate complex intestinal immunity from 16 weeks' gestational age (GA). Both BCR and TCR repertoires are diverse with CDRH and CDR3β length increasing with advancing GA. The difference-from-germline, CDR insertions and/or deletions, similarly occur in utero for TCR but not BCR, suggesting earlier mucosal T than B cell maturity. Innate immunity is dominated by macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), and natural killer (NK) cells. Follicular and transitional B cells are enriched in fetuses while CD69+IgM+ B cells are abundant in infants. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are abundant, capable of secreting cytokines and are phenotypically of the tissue resident memory state in utero. Our data provide the foundation for a 2nd trimester and infant intestinal immune atlas and suggest that a complex innate and adaptive immune landscape exists significantly earlier than previously reported."

While low-dose chemotherapy reduces MDSCs in preclinical models, the use of this strategy to reduce MDSCs in GBM patients has yet to be evaluated.METHODSA phase 0/I dose-escalation clinical trial was conducted in patients with recurrent GBM treated 5-7 days before surgery with low-dose chemotherapy via capecitabine, followed by concomitant low-dose capecitabine and bevacizumab. Clinical outcomes, including progression-free and overall survival, were measured, along with safety and toxicity profiles. Over the treatment time course, circulating MDSC levels were measured by multiparameter flow cytometry, and tumor tissue immune profiles were assessed via time-of-flight mass cytometry.RESULTSEleven patients total were enrolled across escalating dose cohorts of 150, 300, and 450 mg bid. No serious adverse events related to the drug combination were observed. Compared with pretreatment baseline, circulating MDSCs were found to be higher after surgery in the 150-mg treatment arm and lower in the 300-mg and 450-mg treatment arms. Increased cytotoxic immune infiltration was observed after low-dose capecitabine compared with untreated GBM patients in the 300-mg and 450-mg treatment arms.CONCLUSIONSLow-dose, metronomic capecitabine in combination with bevacizumab was well tolerated in GBM patients and was associated with a reduction in circulating MDSC levels and an increase in cytotoxic immune infiltration into the tumor microenvironment.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT02669173.FUNDINGThis research was funded by the Cleveland Clinic, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Musella Foundation, B*CURED, the NIH, the National Cancer Institute, the Sontag Foundation, Blast GBM, the James B.

Electroporation of ribonucleoprotein complexes containing chemically modified synthetic single guide RNAs and purified Cas9 protein induced translocations between chromosomes 9 and 11 [t(9;11)] at an efficiency >1%. Transplantation of gene-edited cells into immune-compromised mice rapidly induced acute leukemias of different lineages and often with multiclonal origins dictated by the duration of in vitro culture prior to transplantation. Breakpoint junction sequences served as biomarkers to monitor clonal selection and progression in culture and in vivo. High-dimensional cell surface and intracellular protein analysis by mass cytometry (CyTOF) revealed that gene-edited leukemias recapitulated disease-specific protein expression observed in human patients and showed that MLL-rearranged (MLLr) mixed phenotype acute leukemias (MPALs) were more similar to acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) than to acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). Therefore, highly efficient generation of MLL chromosomal translocations in primary human blood stem cells using CRISPR/Cas9 reliably models human acute MLLr leukemia and provides an experimental platform for basic and translational studies of leukemia biology and therapeutics."

Epub 2019 Oct 2.,Keywords: FlowSOM; MRD; bone marrow; flow cytometry; machine learning.,"Multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) is a powerful and versatile tool to accurately analyze cell subsets, notably to explore normal and pathological hematopoiesis. Yet, mostly supervised subjective strategies are used to identify cell subsets in this complex tissue. In the past few years, the implementation of mass cytometry and the big data generated have led to a blossoming of new software solutions. Their application to classical MFC in hematology is however still seldom reported. Here, we show how one of these new tools, the FlowSOM R solution, can be applied, together with the Kaluza® software, to a new delineation of hematopoietic subsets in normal human bone marrow (BM). We thus combined the unsupervised discrimination of cell subsets provided by FlowSOM and their expert-driven node-by-node assignment to known or new hematopoietic subsets. We also show how this new tool could modify the MFC exploration of hematological malignancies both at diagnosis (Dg) and follow-up (FU). This can be achieved by direct comparison of merged listmodes of reference normal BM, Dg, and FU samples of a representative acute myeloblastic case tested with the same immunophenotyping panel.

Recently, techniques for analyses of individual cells, such as single-cell RNA-Seq and mass cytometry, have been used to understand the stem cell reprogramming process in the mouse. However, the reprogramming process in hiPSCs remains poorly understood. Here we used mass cytometry to analyze the expression of pluripotency and cell cycle markers in the reprogramming of human stem cells. We confirmed that, during reprogramming, the main cell population was shifted to an intermediate population consisting of neither fibroblasts nor hiPSCs. Detailed population analyses using computational approaches, including dimensional reduction by spanning-tree progression analysis of density-normalized events, PhenoGraph, and diffusion mapping, revealed several distinct cell clusters representing the cells along the reprogramming route. Interestingly, correlation analysis of various markers in hiPSCs revealed that the pluripotency marker TRA-1-60 behaves in a pattern that is different from other pluripotency markers. Furthermore, we found that the expression pattern of another pluripotency marker, octamer-binding protein 4 (OCT4), was distinctive in the pHistone-H3high population (M phase) of the cell cycle. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first mass cytometry-based investigation of human reprogramming and pluripotency. Our analysis elucidates several aspects of hiPSC reprogramming, including several intermediate cell clusters active during the process of reprogramming and distinctive marker expression patterns in hiPSCs."

The brain's immune compartment is a dynamic ensemble of cells that can fluctuate even in naive animals. However, the dynamics and factors that can affect the composition of immune cells in the naive brain are largely unknown. Here, we examined whether acute sleep deprivation can affect the brain's immune compartment (parenchyma, meninges, and choroid plexus). Using high-dimensional mass cytometry analysis, we broadly characterized the effects of short-term sleep deprivation on the immune composition in the mouse brain. We found that after 6 h of sleep deprivation, there was a significant increase in the abundance of B cells in the brain compartment. This effect can be accounted for, at least in part, by the elevated expression of the migration-related receptor, CXCR5, on B cells and its ligand, cxcl13, in the meninges following sleep deprivation. Thus, our study reveals that short-term sleep deprivation affects the brain's immune compartment, offering a new insight into how sleep disorders can affect brain function and potentially contribute to neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation."

Rare-earth metals detected by mass spectrometry have extremely low backgrounds and can be identified with high resolution enabling the routine simultaneous detection of more than 45 probes on each cell without the need for complex compensation matrices. Here we describe a panel of 14 platelet-specific metal-conjugated antibodies (targeting cluster of differentiation [CD] 9, CD29, CD31, CD36, CD41, CD42a, CD42b, CD61, CD62P, CD63, CD107a, CD154, glycoprotein [GP] VI and activated integrin αIIbβ3) and methods for staining and analysis of platelets by mass cytometry. High dimensional clustering algorithms, which take into account the levels of all 14 markers detected by mass cytometry on each cell, allow identification of platelet subpopulations not previously appreciated. We previously reported that platelet heterogeneity identified by mass cytometry appears similar across healthy donors and consistent over time. High dimensional analysis revealed the presence of a platelet subpopulation with significantly higher levels of surface expression of activated GPIIb-IIIa and P-selectin suggesting this subpopulation may play a greater role in thrombus formation than other platelet subpopulations. Thus, analysis by mass cytometry of platelet heterogeneity and subpopulations may suggest distinct biological roles for different platelet subpopulations and may be useful in evaluating inherited or acquired platelet disorders and platelet function in health and disease."

Here, we characterize lung cancer markers using single cell mass cytometry to compare different in vitro cell culturing methods: two-dimensional (2D), carrier-free, or bead-based 3D culturing with in vivo xenografts. Proliferation, viability, and cell cycle phase distribution has been investigated. Gene expression analysis enabled the selection of markers that were overexpressed: TMEM45A, SLC16A3, CD66, SLC2A1, CA9, CD24, or repressed: EGFR either in vivo or in long-term 3D cultures. Additionally, TRA-1-60, pan-keratins, CD326, Galectin-3, and CD274, markers with known clinical significance have been investigated at single cell resolution. The described twelve markers convincingly highlighted a unique pattern reflecting intra-tumor heterogeneity of 3D samples and in vivo A549 lung cancer cells. In 3D systems CA9, CD24, and EGFR showed higher expression than in vivo. Multidimensional single cell proteome profiling revealed that 3D cultures represent a transition from 2D to in vivo conditions by intermediate marker expression of TRA-1-60, TMEM45A, pan-keratin, CD326, MCT4, Gal-3, CD66, GLUT1, and CD274.

Although cancer immunotherapy can result in long-lasting clinical responses, the majority of patients do not respond or develop resistance. Furthermore, cancer immunotherapy is being increasingly combined with other forms of immunotherapy or conventional cancer therapies. It is therefore much needed to identify biomarkers that can precisely classify what patients will benefit from the treatment without any major adverse events and to further develop the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. While much attention has been focused on monitoring T cell responses in cancer immunotherapy, recent reports have shown that NK cells also play a major role in the response to cancer immunotherapy.

The etiology of BCP-ALL is still unknown, but environmental factors, sex, race or ethnicity, and genomic alterations influence the development of the disease. Tools based on protein detection, such as flow cytometry, mass spectrometry, mass cytometry and reverse phase protein array, represent an opportunity to investigate BCP-ALL pathogenesis and to identify new biomarkers of disease. This review aims to document the recent advancements with respect to applications of proteomic technologies to study mechanisms of leukemogenesis, how this information could be used in the discovery of biological targets, and finally we describe the challenges of application of proteomic tools for the approach of BCP-ALL."

While a range of immune lineages is found in the prostate including T cells, B cells and myeloid cells, the specific subsets of immune cells with each major lineage have not been well described. In this study, we use mass cytometry (CyTOF) to comprehensively and reproducibly profile immune cells in mouse and human prostate. Using 4 myeloid markers (CD11b, CD11c, F4/80, Ly6C) in the mouse, we identified 8 phenotypically-distinct myeloid populations, demonstrating considerable heterogeneity within the immune compartment of the mouse prostate. We then profiled the prostate immune microenvironment from 9 human patients. Unlike the mouse prostate which is myeloid-dominant, the immune compartment in the benign human prostate is consistently T-lymphocyte-dominant. Using the X-shift algorithm to identify individual immune subsets based on marker expression, we found 57 phenotypically-distinct immune cell types in the human prostate. Despite similar proportions of T, B and myeloid lineage cells in the benign human prostate of all patients evaluated, we observed considerable interpatient heterogeneity in the abundance of more specific immune subsets. These findings highlight the importance of studying the immune compartment in the prostate at a granular level and will lead to future studies addressing the functional role of specific immune subsets in prostate epithelial transformation."

Among the possible design limitations of CAR-T cells for cancer are unwanted tonic (antigen-independent) signaling and off-target activation. Efforts to overcome these hurdles have been blunted by a lack of mechanistic understanding. Here, we showed that single-cell analysis with time course mass cytometry provided a rapid means of assessing CAR-T cell activation. We compared signal transduction in expanded T cells to that in T cells transduced to express second-generation CARs and found that cell expansion enhanced the response to stimulation. However, expansion also induced tonic signaling and reduced network plasticity, which were associated with expression of the T cell exhaustion markers PD-1 and TIM-3. Because this was most evident in pathways downstream of CD3ζ, we performed similar analyses on γδT cells that expressed chimeric costimulatory receptors (CCRs) lacking CD3ζ but containing DAP10 stimulatory domains. These CCR-γδT cells did not exhibit tonic signaling but were efficiently activated and mounted cytotoxic responses in the presence of CCR-specific stimuli or cognate leukemic cells. Single-cell signaling analysis enabled detailed characterization of CAR-T and CCR-T cell activation to better understand their functional activities. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CCR-γδT cells may offer the potential to avoid on-target, off-tumor toxicity and allo-reactivity in the context of myeloid malignancies."

We also describe best-practice measures for minimizing and tracking batch variability. These include: sample barcoding, use of spiked-in reference cells, and lyophilization of the antibody cocktail. Our protocol assumes the use of cryopreserved PBMC, both for convenience of batching samples and for maximum comparability across patients and time points. Finally, we show an option for automated analysis using the Astrolabe platform (Astrolabe Diagnostics, Inc.)."

The inertness of the complex was evaluated by UV/Vis experiments in several competitive media and was highlighted by the comparison with [In(dota)]- and [In(dtpa)]2- (H4 dota = 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid, H5 dtpa = diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid), which are currently used in biological applications. For the first time, a bifunctional analogue of H2 cb-te2pa was prepared by C-functionalization to keep its coordination properties intact. However, this strategy leads to the formation of two diastereoisomers as evidenced and studied by NMR experiments and DFT calculations. Kinetic studies proved nevertheless that both isomers of the complex are equally inert. They were therefore used without distinction for their covalent grafting on polystyrene beads. The so-called metal-encoded beads were tested for imaging mass cytometry. The detection of 115 In allows the generation of images with high quality, proving the great potential of the bifunctional [In(cb-te2pa)]+ derivatives for single-cell analysis by mass cytometry."

Small molecules containing tellurium are promising probes for IMC due to their cell permeability, synthetic versatility, and most importantly their application to sequential labelling with isotopologous probes (SLIP) experiments. SLIP experiments with tellurium-containing probes allow quantification of intracellular biology at multiple timepoints with IMC. Despite the promise of tellurium in IMC, there are unique challenges in image processing associated with tellurium IMC data. Here, we address some of these issues by demonstrating the removal of xenon background signal, combining channels to improve signal-to-noise ratio, and calculating isotope transmission efficiency biases. These developments add accuracy to the unique temporal resolution afforded by tellurium IMC probes."

While it is known that the fetal immune system develops in sequential waves, relatively little is known about the composition of the innate and adaptive immune system in the tissues. Here, we applied high-dimensional mass cytometry to profile the immune system in human fetal liver, spleen, and intestine. With Hierarchical Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (HSNE) we distinguished 177 distinct immune cell clusters, including both previously identified and novel cell clusters. PCA analysis indicated substantial differences between the compositions of the immune system in the different organs. Through dual t-SNE we identified tissue-specific cell clusters, which were found both in the innate and adaptive compartment. To determine the spatial location of tissue-specific subsets we developed a 31-antibody panel to reveal both the immune compartment and surrounding stromal elements through analysis of snap-frozen tissue samples with imaging mass cytometry. Imaging mass cytometry reconstructed the tissue architecture and allowed both the characterization and determination of the location of the various immune cell clusters within the tissue context. Moreover, it further underpinned the distinctness of the immune system in the tissues. Thus, our results provide evidence for early compartmentalization of the adaptive and innate immune compartment in fetal spleen, liver, and intestine. Together, our data provide a unique and comprehensive overview of the composition and organization of the human fetal immune system in several tissues."

To overcome therapeutic resistance or identify predictive markers, a comprehensive understanding of the immunologic condition in the tumor microenvironment is important. We reviewed the latest scientific findings on the comprehensive immunologic condition within the tumor microenvironment in patients with RCC and its clinical significance. The immunologic condition evaluated by 3 different methods (flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and next-generation sequencing) in 4 different cohorts of patients with RCC could commonly divide the immunologic condition into 2 or 3 groups, all of which were significantly correlated with tumor aggressiveness and patient prognosis. In particular, patients with high T-cell infiltration and immunosuppressive cells including regulatory T cells had the worst prognosis in each cohort. This classification correlated with angiogenesis and metabolism and glycolysis, and it suggested that distinct biology exists in each immunologic classification. Moreover, around 20% to 30% of the RCC patients had intratumor immunologic diversity within each individual; this might help in understanding the presence of radiologic heterogeneity for immunotherapies. In conclusion, a comprehensive understanding of the immune condition is needed for the upcoming era of novel cancer immunotherapy using not only genetic but also phenotypic and functional classifications."

Novel multiparametric cytometry approaches, such as cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) combined with novel gating algorithms can rapidly characterize previously unknown phenotypes in the iTME of tumors and better capture its heterogeneity. Here, we used a 33-marker CyTOF panel to characterize the iTME of dysproteinemia patients (MGUS, multiple myeloma-MM, smoldering MM, and AL amyloidosis) at diagnosis and after standard of care first line therapies (triplet induction chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant-ASCT). We identify novel subsets, some of which are unique to the iTME and absent from matched peripheral blood samples, with potential roles in tumor immunosurveillance as well as tumor immune escape. We find that AL amyloidosis has a distinct iTME compared to other dysproteinemias with higher myeloid and ""innate-like"" T cell subset infiltration. We show that T cell immune senescence might be implicated in disease pathogenesis in patients with trisomies. Finally, we demonstrate that the early post-ASCT period is associated with an increase of senescent and exhausted subsets, which might have implications for the rational selection of post-ASCT therapies."

Flow Cytometry has earned its place as a preferred analysis platform. This technology offers a flexible path to the interrogation of protein expression patterns and detection of functional properties in cell populations of interest. Mass Cytometry is a newcomer technology that has generated significant interest in the field. By incorporating mass spectrometry analysis to the traditional principles of flow cytometry, this innovative tool promises to significantly expand the ability to detect multiple proteins on a single cell. The use of these technologies in a manner that is consistent and reproducible through multiple sample sets demands careful attention to experiment design, reagent selection, and instrumentation. Whether applying flow or mass cytometry, reaching successful, reliable results involves many factors. Sample preparation, antibody titrations, and appropriate controls are major biological considerations that impact cytometric analysis. Additionally, instrument voltages, lasers, and run quality assessments are essential for ensuring comparability and reproducibility between analyses. In this article, we aim to discuss the critical aspects that impact flow cytometry, and will touch on important considerations for mass cytometry as well. Focusing on their relevance to immunotherapy studies, we will address the importance of appropriate sample processing and will discuss how selection of suitable panels, controls, and antibodies must follow a carefully designed plan.

This technique is essential to characterize the phenotypes and functions of immune cell populations, but is currently limited to the measurement of 40 cell markers that restricts the characterization of complex diseases. However, algorithms and multi-tube cytometry techniques have been designed for combining phenotypic information obtained from different cytometric panels. The characterization of chronic HIV infection represents a good study case for multi-tube mass cytometry as this disease triggers a complex interactions network of more than 70 cell markers. Method: We collected whole blood from non-viremic HIV-infected patients on combined antiretroviral therapies and healthy donors. Leukocytes from each individual were stained using three different mass cytometry panels, which consisted of 35, 32, and 33 cell markers. For each patient and using the CytoBackBone algorithm, we combined phenotypic information from three different antibody panels into a single cytometric profile, reaching a phenotypic resolution of 72 markers. These high-resolution cytometric profiles were analyzed using SPADE and viSNE algorithms to decipher the immune response to HIV. Results: We detected an upregulation of several proteins in HIV-infected patients relative to healthy donors using our profiling of 72 cell markers. Among them, CD11a and CD11b were upregulated in PMNs, monocytes, mDCs, NK cells, and T cells. CD11b was also upregulated on pDCs. Other upregulated proteins included: CD38 on PMNs, monocytes, NK cells, basophils, B cells, and T cells; CD83 on monocytes, mDCs, B cells, and T cells; and TLR2, CD32, and CD64 on PMNs and monocytes. These results were validated using a mass cytometry panel of 25 cells markers. Impacts: We demonstrate here that multi-tube cytometry can be applied to mass cytometry for exploring, at an unprecedented level of details, cell populations impacted by complex diseases. We showed that the monocyte and PMN populations were strongly affected by the HIV infection, as CD11a, CD11b, CD32, CD38, CD64, CD83, CD86, and TLR2 were upregulated in these populations. Overall, these results demonstrate that HIV induced a specific environment that similarly affected multiple immune cells."

Pairwise linear regressions between microbial and host immune features provide one approach for quantifying relationships between ""omes"", and the differences in these relationships across study cohorts or arms. This approach yields a top table of candidate results. However, the top table alone lacks the detail that domain experts such as microbiologists and immunologists need to vet candidate results for follow-up experiments."

Methodologies enabling precise information regarding uptake and intracellular distribution of NPs at the single cell level remain to be established. Mass cytometry (MC) has been developed for high-dimensional single cell analyses and is a promising tool to quantify NP-cell interactions. Here, we aim to establish a new MC-based quantification procedure to receive absolute numbers of NPs per single cell by using a calibration that considers the specific transmission efficiency (TE) of suspended NPs. The current MC-quantification strategy accept TE values of complementary metal solutions. In this study, we demonstrate the different transmission behavior of 50 nm silver NPs (AgNP) and silver nitrate solution. We have used identical AgNPs for calibration as for in vitro-differentiated macrophages (THP-1 cell line) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Our quantification relies on silver intensities measuring AgNPs in the same detection mode as the cells. Results were comparable with the TE quantification strategy using AgNPs but differed when using ionic silver. Furthermore, intact and digested cell aliquots were measured to investigate the impact of MC sample processing on the amount of AgNPs/cell. Taken together, we have provided a MC-specific calibration procedure to precisely calculate absolute numbers of NPs per single cell. Combined with its unique feature of multiplexing up to 50 parameters, MC provides much more information on the single cell level than single cell-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SC-ICPMS) and, therefore, offers new opportunities in nanotoxicology."

Critical immune events that discriminate MGUS from newly diagnosed MM (ND)MM patients remain unknown, but may involve changes in the regulatory T cell (Treg) compartment that favor myeloma growth. To address this possibility, we used mass cytometry and the unsupervised clustering algorithm Flow self-organizing map (FlowSOM) to interrogate the distribution of multiple subsets within CD25+CD127low/negTreg in matched bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) of MGUS and NDMM patients. Both mass cytometry and flow cytometry confirmed a trend toward prevalence of CD39-Treg within the Treg compartment in BM and PB of NDMM patients compared to CD39-Treg in MGUS patients. FlowSOM clustering displayed a phenotypic organization of Treg into 25 metaclusters that confirmed Treg heterogeneity. It identified two subsets which emerged within CD39-Treg of NDMM patients that were negligible or absent in CD39-Treg of MGUS patients. One subset was found in both BM and PB which phenotypically resembled activated Treg based on CD45RO, CD49d, and CD62L expression; another subset resembled BM-resident Treg based on its tissue-resident CD69+CD62L-CD49d- phenotype and restricted location within the BM. Both subsets co-expressed PD-1 and TIGIT, but PD-1 was expressed at higher levels on BM-resident Treg than on activated Treg. Within BM, both subsets had limited Perforin and Granzyme B production, whilst activated Treg in PB acquired high Perforin and Granzyme B production. In conclusion, the use of mass cytometry and FlowSOM clustering discovered two discrete subsets of CD39-Treg which are discordant in MGUS and NDMM patients and may be permissive of myeloma growth which warrants further study. Understanding the regulatory properties of these subsets may also advance MGUS and MM diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic implications for MM patients."

We quantified the frequency of circulating immune-cells in 169 patients with these SADs and 44 healty controls (HC) using mass-cytometry and assessed the diagnostic value of these results. Alterations in the frequency of immune-cell subsets were present in all SADs compared to HC. Most alterations, including a decrease of CD56hi NK-cells in SSc and IgM+ Bcells in pSS, were disease specific; only a reduced frequency of plasmacytoid dendritic cells was common between all SADs Strikingly, hierarchical clustering of SSc patients identified 4 clusters associated with different clinical phenotypes, and 9 of the 12 cell subset-alterations in SSc were also present during the preclinical-phase of the disease. Additionally, we found a strong association between the use of prednisone and alterations in B-cell subsets. Although differences in immune-cell frequencies between these SADs are apparent, the discriminative value thereof is too low for diagnostic purposes. Within each disease, mass cytometry analyses revealed distinct patterns between endophenotypes. Given the lack of tools enabling early diagnosis of SSc, our results justify further research into the value of cellular phenotyping as a diagnostic aid."

Both cell types can adopt diverse functional states that play critical roles in lesion formation and resolution. In order to identify phenotypic subsets of myeloid cells and astrocytes, we profiled two active MS lesions with thirteen glial activation markers using imaging mass cytometry (IMC), a method for multiplexed labeling of histological sections. In the acutely demyelinating lesion, we found multiple distinct myeloid and astrocyte phenotypes that populated separate lesion zones. In the post-demyelinating lesion, phenotypes were less distinct and more uniformly distributed. In both lesions cell-to-cell interactions were not random, but occurred between specific glial subpopulations and lymphocytes. Finally, we demonstrated that myeloid, but not astrocyte phenotypes were activated along a lesion rim-to-center gradient, and that marker expression in glial cells at the lesion rim was driven more by cell-extrinsic factors than in cells at the center. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that highly multiplexed tissue imaging, combined with the appropriate computational tools, is a powerful approach to study heterogeneity, spatial distribution and cellular interactions in the context of MS lesions. Identifying glial phenotypes and their interactions at different lesion stages may provide novel therapeutic targets for inhibiting acute demyelination and low-grade, chronic inflammation."

CD16 expression distinguishes a subset of monocytes with highly pro-inflammatory properties from non-CD16 expressing ""classical"" monocytes. CD14 expression further subdivides the CD16+ monocytes into non-classical CD14low and intermediate CD14high subsets. This long-standing CD16-CD14 classification system, however, has limitations as CD14 is expressed in a continuum, leading to subjectivity in delineating the non-classical and intermediate subsets; in addition, CD16 expression is unstable, making identification of the subsets impossible after in vitro culture or during inflammatory conditions in vivo. Hence, we aimed to identify the three monocyte subsets using an alternative combination of markers. Additionally, we wanted to address whether the monocyte subset perturbations observed during infection is real or an artifact of differential CD16 and/or CD14 regulation. Using cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF), we studied the simultaneous expression of 34 monocyte markers on total monocytes, and derived a combination of five markers (CD33, CD86, CD64, HLA-DR, and CCR2), that could objectively delineate the three subsets. Using these markers, we could also distinguish CD16+ monocytes from CD16- monocytes after in vitro stimulation. Finally, we found that the observed expansion of intermediate (CD14high) monocytes in dengue virus-infected patients was due to up-regulated CD16 expression on classical monocytes. With our new combination of markers, we can now identify monocyte subsets without CD16 and CD14, and accurately re-examine monocyte subset perturbations in diseases."

Dysregulation of the antibody response can lead to an autoimmune disease, malignancy, or enhanced infection. Since the experimental delineation of a distinct B cell lineage in 1965, various methods have been developed to understand antigen-specific B cell responses in the context of autoimmune diseases, primary immunodeficiencies, infection, and vaccination. In this review, we summarize the established techniques and discuss new and emerging technologies for probing the B cell response in vitro and in vivo by taking advantage of the specificity of B cell receptor (BCR)-associated and secreted antibodies. These include ELISPOT, flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and fluorescence microscopy to identify and/or isolate primary antigen-specific B cells. We also present our approach to identify rare antigen-specific B cells using magnetic enrichment followed by flow cytometry. Once these cells are isolated, in vitro proliferation assays and adoptive transfer experiments in mice can be used to further characterize antigen-specific B cell activation, function, and fate. Transgenic mouse models of B cells targeting model antigens and of B cell signaling have also significantly advanced our understanding of antigen-specific B cell responses in vivo."

Using this experimental model, we performed high-dimensional analysis of lung immune cells in DAH by mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing. We found a large influx of myeloid cells to the lungs in DAH and defined the gene expression profile of infiltrating monocytes. Bone marrow-derived inflammatory monocytes actively migrated to the lungs and homed adjacent to blood vessels. Using 3 models of monocyte deficiency and complementary transfer studies, we established a central role of inflammatory monocytes in the development of DAH. We further found that the myeloid transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 8 is essential to the development of both DAH and type I interferon-dependent autoimmunity. These findings collectively reveal monocytes as a potential treatment target in DAH."

We reported previously that combined BCR-ABL1 and BCL-2 inhibition synergistically targets CML stem/progenitor cells. p53 induces apoptosis mainly by modulating BCL-2 family proteins. Although infrequently mutated in CML, p53 is antagonized by MDM2, which is regulated by BCR-ABL1 signaling. We hypothesized that MDM2 inhibition could sensitize CML cells to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Using an inducible transgenic Scl-tTa-BCR-ABL1 murine CML model, we found, by RT-PCR and CyTOF proteomics increased p53 signaling in CML bone marrow (BM) cells compared with controls in CD45+ and linage-SCA-1+C-KIT+ populations. CML BM cells were more sensitive to exogenous BH3 peptides than controls. Combined inhibition of BCR-ABL1 with imatinib and MDM2 with DS-5272 increased NOXA level, markedly reduced leukemic linage-SCA-1+C-KIT+ cells and hematopoiesis, decreased leukemia burden, significantly prolonged the survival of mice engrafted with BM cells from Scl-tTa-BCR-ABL1 mice, and significantly decreased CML stem cell frequency in secondary transplantations. Our results suggest that CML stem/progenitor cells have increased p53 signaling and a propensity for apoptosis. Combined MDM2 and BCR-ABL1 inhibition targets CML stem/progenitor cells and has the potential to improve cure rates for CML."

Dendritic cells (DCs) play a pivotal role in anti-tumor immunity owing to their outstanding T cell activation ability. Their functions and activities are broad ranged, triggering different mechanisms and responses to the DC subset. Several studies identified in situ human tumor-infiltrating DCs by immunostaining using a limited number of markers. However, considering the heterogeneity of DC subsets, the identification of each subtype present in the immune infiltrate is essential. To achieve this, studies initially relied on flow cytometry analyses to provide a precise characterization of tumor-associated DC subsets based on a combination of multiple markers. The concomitant development of advanced technologies, such as mass cytometry or complete transcriptome sequencing of a cell population or at a single cell level, has provided further details on previously identified populations, has unveiled previously unknown populations, and has finally led to the standardization of the DCs classification across tissues and species. Here, we review the evolution of tumor-associated DC description, from in situ visualization to their characterization with high-dimensional technologies, and the clinical use of these findings specifically focusing on the prognostic impact of DCs in cancers."

Fluidigm's third-generation Helios mass cytometer introduced a number of upgrades over the previous CyTOF2. One of these new features is a modified narrow bore sample injector that generates smaller ion clouds, which is expected to improve sensitivity and throughput. However, following rigorous testing, we find that the narrow-bore sample injector may have unintended negative consequences on data quality and result in lower median and higher coefficients of variation in many antibody-associated signal intensities. We describe an alternative Helios acquisition protocol using a wider bore injector, which largely mitigates these data quality issues. We directly compare these two protocols in a multisite study of 10 Helios instruments across 7 institutions and show that the modified protocol improves data quality and reduces interinstrument variability.

This associated with an expansion of Spn polysaccharide-specific and total plasmablasts in blood. Moreover, increased responses of blood mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells against in vitro stimulation with pneumococcus prior to challenge associated with protection against establishment of Spn colonization and with increased mucosal MAIT cell populations. These results implicate MAIT cells in the protection against pneumococcal colonization and demonstrate that colonization affects mucosal and circulating B cell populations."

Previous investigations failed to consistently detect IFNα mRNA in HCV-infected livers, suggesting that pDCs may be incapable of producing IFNα. We used a combination of molecular, biochemical, cytometric, and high-dimensional techniques to analyze DC frequencies/functions in liver and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients, to examine correlations between DC function and gene expression of matched whole liver tissue and liver mononuclear cells (LMCs), and to determine if pDCs can produce multiple cytokines. T cells often produce multiple cytokines/chemokines but until recently technical limitations have precluded tests of polyfunctionality in individual pDCs. Mass cytometry (CyTOF) revealed that liver pDCs are the only LMC that produces detectable amounts of IFNα in response TLR-7/8 stimulation. Liver pDCs secreted large quantities of IFNα (~2 million molecules of IFNα/cell/hour) and produced more IFNα than PBMCs after stimulation, p = 0.0001. LMCs secreted >14-fold more IFNα than IFNλ in 4 hours. Liver pDC frequency positively correlated with whole liver expression of ""IFNα-response"" pathway (R2 = 0.58, p = 0.007) and ""monocyte surface"" signature (R2 = 0.54, p = 0.01). Mass cytometry revealed that IFNα-producing pDCs were highly polyfunctional; >90% also made 2-4 additional cytokines/chemokines of our test set of 10. Liver BDCA1 DCs, but not BDCA3 DCs, were similarly polyfunctional. pDCs from a healthy liver were also polyfunctional. Our data show that liver pDCs retain the ability to make abundant IFNα during chronic HCV infection and produce many other immune modulators. Polyfunctional liver pDCs are likely to be key drivers of inflammation and immune activation during chronic HCV infection."

Many herpesviruses use the IL-10 pathway to facilitate infection, but how endogenous IL-10 is regulated during primary infection in vivo remains poorly characterized. In this study, we infected mice with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (γHV68) and analyzed the production and genetic contribution of IL-10 by mass cytometry (cytometry by time-of-flight) analysis. γHV68 infection elicited a breadth of effector CD4 T cells in the lungs of acutely infected mice, including a highly activated effector subset that coexpressed IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-10. By using IL-10 GFP transcriptional reporter mice, we identified that IL-10 was primarily expressed within CD4 T cells during acute infection in the lungs. IL10gfp-expressing CD4 T cells were highly proliferative and characterized by the expression of multiple coinhibitory receptors, including PD-1 and LAG-3. When we analyzed acute γHV68 infection of IL-10-deficient mice, we found that IL-10 limits the frequency of both myeloid and effector CD4 T cell subsets in the infected lung, with minimal changes at a distant mucosal site. These data emphasize the unique insights that high-dimensional analysis can afford in investigating antiviral immunity and provide new insights into the breadth, phenotype, and function of IL-10-expressing effector CD4 T cells during acute virus infection."

Research over past decades have profoundly enhanced our understanding of immunotherapy, a major clinical accomplishment, and its potential role toward treating CC. However, studies investigating the expression of these immune checkpoints, such as epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), programmed death-1 (PD-1), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is lacking. Here, high-dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) is used to investigate immune alterations and promising immunotherapeutic targets expression by PBMCs of CC patients. Results reveal that expression of EpCAM and PD-L1 on CD4+ T cells significantly increased in patients with CC, compared with age- and sex- matching healthy controls and patients with colonic polyps. These differences are also validated in an independent patient cohort using flow cytometry. Further analysis revealed that EpCAM+ CD4+ T cells are PD-L1+ CCR5+ CCR6+. Immunofluorescence staining results demonstrate that the increase of EpCAM+ CD4+ T cells is also observed in tumor tissues, rather than para-cancerous tissues. To ascertain the functional disorders of the identified cell subset, phosphorylated signaling protein levels are assessed using imaging mass cytometry. Increases in pp38 MAPK and pMAPKAPK2 are observable, indicating abnormal activation of pp38 MAPK-pMAPKAPK2 signaling pathway. Results in this study indicate that EpCAM+ CD4+ T cells may play a role in CC development. Detailed knowledge on the functionality of EpCAM+ CD4+ T cells is of high translational relevance."

RA is a heterogeneous disease with a plethora of treatment options. The pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of RA, and TNF inhibitors effectively repress inflammatory activity in RA. Currently, treatment decisions are primarily based on empirics and economic considerations. However, the considerable interpatient variability in response to treatment is a challenge. Markers for a more exact patient classification and stratification are lacking. The objective of this study was to identify markers in immune cell populations that distinguish RA patients from healthy donors with an emphasis on TNF signaling. We employed mass cytometry (CyTOF) with a panel of 13 phenotyping and 10 functional markers to explore signaling in unstimulated and TNF-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 20 newly diagnosed, untreated RA patients and 20 healthy donors. The resulting high-dimensional data were analyzed in three independent analysis pipelines, characterized by differences in both data clean-up, identification of cell subsets/clustering and statistical approaches. All three analysis pipelines identified p-p38, IkBa, p-cJun, p-NFkB, and CD86 in cells of both the innate arm (myeloid dendritic cells and classical monocytes) and the adaptive arm (memory CD4+ T cells) of the immune system as markers for differentiation between RA patients and healthy donors. Inclusion of the markers p-Akt and CD120b resulted in the correct classification of 18 of 20 RA patients and 17 of 20 healthy donors in regression modeling based on a combined model of basal and TNF-induced signal. Expression patterns in a set of functional markers and specific immune cell subsets were distinct in RA patients compared to healthy individuals. These signatures may support studies of disease pathogenesis, provide candidate markers for response, and non-response to TNF inhibitor treatment, and aid the identification of future therapeutic targets."

However, current analyses of scRNA-Seq data usually start from unsupervised clustering or visualization. These methods ignore prior knowledge of transcriptomes and the probable structures of the data. Moreover, cell identification heavily relies on subjective and possibly inaccurate human inspection afterwards. To address these analytical challenges, we developed SCINA (Semi-supervised Category Identification and Assignment), a semi-supervised model that exploits previously established gene signatures using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. SCINA is applicable to scRNA-Seq and flow cytometry/CyTOF data, as well as other data of similar format. We applied SCINA to a wide range of datasets, and showed its accuracy, stability and efficiency, which exceeded most popular unsupervised approaches. SCINA discovered an intermediate stage of oligodendrocytes from mouse brain scRNA-Seq data. SCINA also detected immune cell population changes in cytometry data in a genetically-engineered mouse model. Furthermore, SCINA performed well with bulk gene expression data. Specifically, we identified a new kidney tumor clade with similarity to FH-deficient tumors (FHD), which we refer to as FHD-like tumors (FHDL). Overall, SCINA provides both methodological advances and biological insights from perspectives different from traditional analytical methods."

We present here a mass cytometry (CyTOF) workflow for standardized, systems-level biomarker discovery in immunotherapy trials. To broadly enumerate immune cell identity and activity, we established and extensively assessed a reference panel of 33 antibodies to cover major cell subsets, simultaneously quantifying activation and immune checkpoint molecules in a single assay. This assay enumerates ≥98% of peripheral immune cells with ≥4 positively identifying antigens. Robustness and reproducibility are demonstrated on multiple samples types, across two research centers and by orthogonal measurements. Using automated analysis, we identify stratifying immune signatures in bone marrow transplantation-associated graft-versus-host disease. Together, this validated workflow ensures comprehensive immunophenotypic analysis and data comparability and will accelerate biomarker discovery."

The study focused on changes in lymphocyte subsets in blood and lymphoid tissues and on potential novel biomarkers as a result of anti-CD20 antibody action in Cynomolgus monkeys treated with human equivalent doses of subcutaneous (s.c.) ofatumumab on Days 0, 7, and 14. Axillary lymph nodes (LNs) and blood samples were collected at various time points until Day 90. Lymphocyte subsets were quantified by flow cytometry, while morphological and immune cell changes were assessed by imaging mass cytometry (IMC), immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridization (ISH), and transcriptome analyses using single-cell methodology. Ofatumumab treatment resulted in a potent and rapid reduction of B cells along with a simultaneous drop in CD20+ T cell counts. At Day 21, IHC revealed B-cell depletion in the perifollicular and interfollicular area of axillary LNs, while only the core of the germinal center was depleted of CD20+CD21+ cells. By Day 62, the perifollicular and interfollicular areas were abundantly infiltrated by CD21+ B cells and this distribution returned to the baseline cytoarchitecture by Day 90. By IMC CD20+CD3+CD8+ cells could be identified at the margin of the follicles, with a similar pattern of distribution at Day 21 and 90. Single-cell transcriptomics analysis showed that ofatumumab induced reversible changes in t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) defined B-cell subsets that may serve as biomarkers for drug action. In summary, low dose s.c. ofatumumab potently depletes both B cells and CD20+ T cells but apparently spares marginal zone (MZ) B cells in the spleen and LN. These findings add to our molecular and tissue-architectural understanding of ofatumumab treatment effects on B-cell subsets."

Here, we report a comprehensive atlas of bone marrow stromal cell subpopulations under homeostatic and stress conditions using mass cytometry (CyTOF)-based single-cell protein analysis. We identified 28 subsets of non-hematopoietic cells during homeostasis, 14 of which expressed hematopoietic regulatory factors. Irradiation-based conditioning for HSPC transplantation led to the loss of most of these populations, including the LeptinR+ and Nestin+ subsets. In contrast, a subset expressing Ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73) was retained and a specific CD73+NGFRhigh population expresses high levels of cytokines during homeostasis and stress. Genetic ablation of CD73 compromised HSPC transplantation in an acute setting without long-term changes in bone marrow HSPCs. Thus, this protein-based expression mapping reveals distinct sets of stromal cells in the bone marrow and how they change in clinically relevant stress settings to contribute to early stages of hematopoietic regeneration."

Epub 2019 Jul 4.,Article has no keywords,"The bone marrow of patients with low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is often an inflammatory environment and associated with an active cellular immune response. An active immune response generally contributes to antitumor responses and may prevent disease progression. However, chronic immune stimulation can also induce cell stress, DNA damage and contribute to the pathogenesis of MDS. The protective mechanisms against excessive immune activation are therefore an important aspect of the pathophysiology of MDS and characterizing them may help us to better understand the fine balance between protective and destabilizing inflammation in lower-risk disease. In this study we investigated the role of thrombomodulin (CD141/BDCA-3) expression, a molecule with anti-inflammatory properties, on monocytes in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of MDS patients in different risk groups. Patient-derived classical monocytes showed high expression levels of thrombomodulin, whereas monocytes from healthy donors hardly expressed any thrombomodulin. The presence of thrombomodulin on monocytes from MDS patients correlated with lower-risk disease groups and better overall and leukemia-free survival. Using multidimensional mass cytometry, in an in-vitro setting, we showed that thrombomodulin-positive monocytes could polarize naïve T cells toward cell clusters which are closer to T helper type 2 and T regulatory cell phenotypes and less likely to contribute to effective immune surveillance. In conclusion, the expression of thrombomodulin on classical monocytes is a favorable and early prognostic marker in patients with low-risk MDS and may represent a new mechanism in the protection against disproportionate immune activation."

Quantitative network modelling from perturbation data reveals that activation of ERK is shaped by cell type-specific MEK to ERK feed forward and negative feedback signalling. We identify dual-specificity phosphatases as candidate modulators of ERK in the intestine.

However, early diagnosis of preeclampsia remains a clinical challenge. Alterations in the normal immune adaptations necessary for the maintenance of a healthy pregnancy are central features of preeclampsia. However, prior analyses primarily focused on the static assessment of select immune cell subsets have provided limited information for the prediction of preeclampsia. Here, we used a high-dimensional mass cytometry immunoassay to characterize the dynamic changes of over 370 immune cell features (including cell distribution and functional responses) in maternal blood during healthy and preeclamptic pregnancies. We found a set of eight cell-specific immune features that accurately identified patients well before the clinical diagnosis of preeclampsia (median area under the curve (AUC) 0.91, interquartile range [0.82-0.92]). Several features recapitulated previously known immune dysfunctions in preeclampsia, such as elevated pro-inflammatory innate immune responses early in pregnancy and impaired regulatory T (Treg) cell signaling. The analysis revealed additional novel immune responses that were strongly associated with, and preceded the onset of preeclampsia, notably abnormal STAT5ab signaling dynamics in CD4+T cell subsets (AUC 0.92, p = 8.0E-5). These results provide a global readout of the dynamics of the maternal immune system early in pregnancy and lay the groundwork for identifying clinically-relevant immune dysfunctions for the prediction and prevention of preeclampsia."

As a proof of concept, we present here a workflow for multidimensional Imaging Mass Cytometry™ (IMC™) and data processing with open source computational tools. CellProfiler was used to identify single cells through establishing cellular boundaries, followed by histoCAT™ (histology topography cytometry analysis toolbox) for extracting single-cell quantitative information visualized as t-SNE plots and heatmaps. Human breast cancer-derived cell lines SKBR3, HCC1143, and MCF-7 were screened for expression of cellular markers to generate digital images with a resolution comparable to conventional fluorescence microscopy. Predicted pharmacodynamic effects were measured in MCF-7 cells dosed with three target-specific compounds: growth stimulatory EGF, microtubule depolymerization agent nocodazole, and genotoxic chemotherapeutic drug etoposide. We show strong pairwise correlation between nuclear markers pHistone3S28 , Ki-67, and p4E-BP1T37/T46 in classified mitotic cells and anticorrelation with cell surface markers.

The screen recapitulates many known trends in the immune system and reveals potential markers for delineating MAIT cells. Additionally, we examine the effect of fixation on staining intensity and identify several markers where fixation leads to either gain or loss of signal. The standardized workflow can be seamlessly integrated into existing trials. Finally, the antibody staining data set is available as an online resource for researchers who are designing mass cytometry experiments in suspension and tissue."

We identify glucose metabolism as a crucial driver of histone acetylation and myogenic cell fate. We use single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) and flow cytometry to characterize the histone acetylation and metabolic states of quiescent, activated, and differentiating muscle stem cells (MuSCs). We find glucose is dispensable for mitochondrial respiration in proliferating MuSCs, so that glucose becomes available for maintaining high histone acetylation via acetyl-CoA. Conversely, quiescent and differentiating MuSCs increase glucose utilization for respiration and have consequently reduced acetylation. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity serves as a rheostat for histone acetylation and must be controlled for muscle regeneration. Increased PDH activity in proliferation increases histone acetylation and chromatin accessibility at genes that must be silenced for differentiation to proceed, and thus promotes self-renewal. These results highlight metabolism as a determinant of MuSC histone acetylation, fate, and function during muscle regeneration."

Cells in suspension were isolated, online extracted by sheath fluid, and lysed during gas-assisted electrospray, followed by real-time MS analysis. Hundreds of metabolites, including nucleotides, amino acids, peptides, carbohydrates, fatty acyls, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids, were detected and identified from one single cell. Discrimination of four types of cancer cell lines and even three subtypes of breast cancer cells was readily achieved using their distinct metabolic profiles. Furthermore, we screened out 102 characteristic ions from 615 detected peak signals for distinguishing breast cancer cell subtypes and identified 40 characteristic molecules which exhibited significant differences among these subtypes and would be potential metabolic markers for clinical diagnosis. CyESI-MS is expected to be a new-generation mass cytometry for studying cell heterogeneity on the metabolic level."

The ubiquity of multidimensional data has motivated the replacement of user-guided clustering with fully automated clustering. The fully automated methods are designed to make clustering more accurate, standardized and faster. However, the adoption of these methods is still limited by the lack of intuitive visualization and cluster matching methods that would allow users to readily interpret fully automatically generated clusters. To address these issues, we developed a fully automated subset identification and characterization (SIC) pipeline providing robust cluster matching and data visualization tools for high-dimensional flow/mass cytometry (and other) data. This pipeline automatically (and intuitively) generates two-dimensional representations of high-dimensional datasets that are safe from the curse of dimensionality. This new approach allows more robust and reproducible data analysis,+ facilitating the development of new gold standard practices across laboratories and institutions."

While this approach has obvious potential for data visualization it remains unclear how t-SNE analysis compares to conventional manual hand-gating in stratifying and quantitating the frequency of diverse immune cell populations. We applied a comprehensive 38-parameter mass cytometry panel to human blood and compared the frequencies of 28 immune cell subsets using both conventional bivariate and t-SNE-guided manual gating. t-SNE analysis was capable of stratifying every general cellular lineage and most sub-lineages with high correlation between conventional and t-SNE-guided cell frequency calculations. However, specific immune cell subsets delineated by the manual gating of continuous variables were not fully separated in t-SNE space thus causing discrepancies in subset identification and quantification between these analytical approaches. Overall, these studies highlight the consistency between t-SNE and conventional hand-gating in stratifying general immune cell lineages while demonstrating that particular cell subsets defined by conventional manual gating may be intermingled in t-SNE space."

We performed high-throughput multiparameter single-cell phenotyping by mass cytometry to obtain a global vision of the immune system in blood and bone marrow. Circulating polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) with impaired phagocytosis had altered surface expression of CD62L and CD11b during early chronic infection. The initiation of combinational antiretroviral treatment during primary infection did not restore PMN function. The maturation state of PMNs was highly altered during late chronic SIV infection, showing a primarily immature phenotype. Our results provide new insights into PMN involvement in the pathogenesis of HIV infection and may play a role in the establishment and maintenance of chronic immune activation."

ChP produces a profound local inflammatory response to dysbiotic oral microbiota that leads to destruction of alveolar bone and tooth loss. ChP is also associated with systemic illnesses, including cardiovascular diseases, malignancies, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, the mechanisms underlying these adverse health outcomes are poorly understood. In this prospective cohort study, we used a highly multiplex mass cytometry immunoassay to perform an in-depth analysis of the systemic consequences of ChP in patients before (n = 28) and after (n = 16) periodontal treatment. A high-dimensional analysis of intracellular signaling networks revealed immune system-wide dysfunctions differentiating patients with ChP from healthy controls. Notably, we observed exaggerated proinflammatory responses to Porphyromonas gingivalis-derived lipopolysaccharide in circulating neutrophils and monocytes from patients with ChP. Simultaneously, natural killer cell responses to inflammatory cytokines were attenuated. Importantly, the immune alterations associated with ChP were no longer detectable 3 wk after periodontal treatment. Our findings demarcate systemic and cell-specific immune dysfunctions in patients with ChP, which can be temporarily reversed by the local treatment of ChP. Future studies in larger cohorts are needed to test the boundaries of generalizability of our results."

Anti-inflammatory strategies can only partially prevent fibrosis; hence, anti-fibrotic therapies remain an unmet clinical need. Oxysterols are oxidised cholesterol derivatives with important roles in various biological processes. The enzyme cholesterol 25-hydroxylase [CH25H] converts cholesterol to 25-hydroxycholesterol [25-HC], which modulates immune responses and oxidative stress. In human intestinal samples from CD patients, we found a strong correlation of CH25H mRNA expression with the expression of fibrosis markers. We demonstrate reduced intestinal fibrosis in mice deficient for the CH25H enzyme, using the sodium dextran sulphate [DSS]-induced chronic colitis model. Additionally, using a heterotopic transplantation model of intestinal fibrosis, we demonstrate reduced collagen deposition and lower concentrations of hydroxyproline in CH25H knockouts. In the heterotopic transplant model, CH25H was expressed in fibroblasts. Taken together, our findings indicate an involvement of oxysterol synthesis in the pathogenesis of intestinal fibrosis."

The small amount of tissue obtained by renal biopsy has previously limited the ability to use patient samples for discovery purposes. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) is an ideal technology for quantitative interrogation of scarce samples, permitting concurrent analysis of more than 40 markers on a single tissue section. Using a validated panel of metal-conjugated antibodies designed to confer unique signatures on the structural and infiltrating cells comprising the human kidney, we performed simultaneous multiplexed imaging with IMC in 23 channels on 16 histopathologically normal human samples. We devised a machine-learning pipeline (Kidney-MAPPS) to perform single-cell segmentation, phenotyping, and quantification, thus creating a spatially preserved quantitative atlas of the normal human kidney. These data define selected baseline renal cell types, respective numbers, organization, and variability. We demonstrate the utility of IMC coupled to Kidney-MAPPS to qualitatively and quantitatively distinguish individual cell types and reveal expected as well as potentially novel abnormalities in diseased versus normal tissue. Our studies define a critical baseline data set for future quantitative analysis of human kidney disease."

We sought to examine whether macrophages or other hematopoietic cells found in the embryo prior to HSC generation were involved in the AGM HSC-generative microenvironment. CyTOF analysis of CD45+ AGM cells revealed predominance of two hematopoietic cell types, mannose-receptor positive macrophages and mannose-receptor negative myeloid cells. We show here that macrophage appearance in the AGM was dependent on the chemokine receptor Cx3cr1. These macrophages expressed a pro-inflammatory signature, localized to the aorta, and dynamically interacted with nascent and emerging intra-aortic hematopoietic cells (IAHCs). Importantly, upon macrophage depletion, no adult-repopulating HSCs were detected, thus implicating a role for pro-inflammatory AGM-associated macrophages in regulating the development of HSCs."

However, flow cytometry is limited by the number of parameters that can be simultaneously analyzed, severely restricting its utility. Recently, the advent of mass cytometry (CyTOF) has enabled high dimensional and unbiased examination of the immune system, allowing simultaneous interrogation of a large number of parameters. This is important for deep interrogation of immune responses and particularly when sample sizes are limited (such as in tumors). Our goal was to compare the accuracy and reproducibility of CyTOF against flow cytometry as a reliable analytic tool for human PBMC and tumor tissues for cancer clinical trials. We developed a 40+ parameter CyTOF panel and demonstrate that compared to flow cytometry, CyTOF yields analogous quantification of cell lineages in conjunction with markers of cell differentiation, function, activation, and exhaustion for use with fresh and viably frozen PBMC or tumor tissues. Further, we provide a protocol that enables reliable quantification by CyTOF down to low numbers of input human cells, an approach that is particularly important when cell numbers are limiting. Thus, we validate CyTOF as an accurate approach to perform high dimensional analysis in human tumor tissue and to utilize low cell numbers for subsequent immunologic studies and cancer clinical trials."

Flow cytometry is still one of the most versatile and high-throughput approaches for single-cell analysis, and its capability has been recently extended to detect up to 28 colors, thus approaching the utility of cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF). However, flow cytometry suffers from autofluorescence and spreading error (SE) generated by errors in the measurement of photons mainly at red and far-red wavelengths, which limit barcoding and the detection of dim markers. Consequently, development of 28-color fluorescent antibody panels for flow cytometry is laborious and time consuming. Here, we describe the steps that are required to successfully achieve 28-color measurement capability. To do this, we provide a reference map of the fluorescence spreading errors in the 28-color space to simplify panel design and predict the success of fluorescent antibody combinations. Finally, we provide detailed instructions for the computational analysis of such complex data by existing, popular algorithms (PhenoGraph and FlowSOM). We exemplify our approach by designing a high-dimensional panel to characterize the immune system, but we anticipate that our approach can be used to design any high-dimensional flow cytometry panel of choice. The full protocol takes a few days to complete, depending on the time spent on panel design and data analysis."

Staining of the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 X4 and MDA-MB-468 was achieved using receptor-specific hybrid tracers, containing both a fluorophore and a DTPA single-lanthanide chelate. Prior to LA-ICP-MS imaging, fluorescence confocal microscopy (FCM) imaging was performed to localize the receptors, hereby enabling direct comparison. Based on the different expression levels of CXCR4 and EGFR, a distinction could be made between the cell lines using both imaging modalities. Furthermore, FCM and LA-ICP-MS demonstrated complementary characteristics, as a more distinct discrimination could be made between both cell lines based on the EGFR-targeting hybrid tracer via LA-ICP-MS, due to the intrinsic CXCR4-related green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal present in the MDA-MB-231 X4 cells. Employing state-of-the-art LA-ICP-MS instrumentation in bidirectional area scanning mode for sub-cellular imaging of MDA-MB-231 X4 cells enabled the specific binding of the CXCR4-targeting hybrid tracer to the cell membrane to be clearly demonstrated. The stretching of cells over the glass substrate led to a considerably higher signal response for pixels at the cell edges, relative to the more central pixels. The determination of the expression levels of CXCR4 and EGFR for the MDA-MB-468 cell line was performed using LA-ICP-MS single-cell analysis (sc-LA-ICP-MS) and external calibration, based on the quantitative ablation of Ho-spiked dried gelatin droplet standards. Additionally, a second calibration approach was applied based on spot ablation of highly homogeneous dried gelatin gels in combination with the determination of the ablated volume using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and yielded results which were in good agreement with the expression levels determined via flow cytometry (FC) and mass cytometry (MC). Hybrid tracers enable a direct comparison between (i) FCM and LA-ICP-MS imaging for the evaluation of the microscopic binding pattern and between (ii) FC, MC and sc-LA-ICP-MS for the quantification of receptor expression levels in single cells."

Measurements by CyTOF allow for a wide range of cells to be analyzed at once, due to the availability of a large staining panel without the complication of fluorescence spillover. These are also compatible with direct detection of integrated iodine signal, with minimal impact on immunophenotyping based on the surface markers. Mathematical modeling beyond a binary classification of surface marker abundance allows for a continuum of cellular states as the cells transition from one state to another.

Here, we used mass cytometry and multi-parametric flow cytometry to characterize human leukocytes infiltrating a human breast cancer tumor model in immunocompromised NOD.SCID.γc-null mice reconstituted with a human immune system and compared it to samples of breast cancer patients. We observed highly activated human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the tumor, as well as minor subsets of innate immune cells in both settings. We also report that ICOS+ CD4+ regulatory T cells (Treg) were enriched in the tumor relative to the periphery in humanized mice and patients, providing a target to affect Treg and tumor growth. Indeed, administration of a neutralizing mAb to human ICOS reduced Treg proportions and numbers and improved CD4 + T cell proliferation in humanized mice. Moreover, a combination of the anti-ICOS mAb with cyclophosphamide reduced tumor growth, and that was associated with an improved CD8 to Treg ratio. Depletion of human CD8+ T cells or of murine myeloid cells marginally affected the effect of the combination therapy. Altogether, our results indicate that a combination of anti-ICOS mAb and chemotherapy controls tumor growth in humanized mice, opening new perspectives for the treatment of breast cancer. One sentence summary: Targeting ICOS in combination with chemotherapy is a promising strategy to improve tumor immunity in humans."

There are seven important steps: separation of the epidermis from the dermis, digestion of the epidermis, staining of the epidermal cell populations with cisplatin, sample barcoding, staining with metal tagged antibodies for cell cycle markers and proteins of interest, detection of metal-tagged antibodies by mass cytometry, and the analysis of expression in the various cell cycle phases. The advantage of this approach over histological methods is the potential to assay the expression pattern of >40 different markers in a single cell at different phases of the cell cycle. This approach also allows for the multivariate correlation analysis of protein expression that is more quantifiable than histological/imaging methods. The disadvantage of this protocol is that a suspension of single cells is needed, which results in the loss of location information provided by the staining of tissue sections. This approach may also require the inclusion of additional markers to identify different cell types in crude cell suspensions. The application of this protocol is evident in the analysis of hyperplastic skin disease models. Moreover, this protocol can be adapted for the analysis of specific sub-type of cells (e.g., stem cells) by the addition of lineage-specific antibodies. This protocol can also be adapted for the analysis of skin cells in other experimental species."

The time from onset of islet autoimmunity to manifest clinical disease can vary widely in length, and it is fairly uncharacterized both clinically and immunologically. In the current study, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from autoantibody-positive children with high risk for T1D, and from age-matched healthy individuals, were analyzed by mass cytometry using a panel of 32 antibodies. Surface markers were chosen to identify multiple cell types including T, B, NK, monocytes, and DC, and antibodies specific for identification of differentiation, activation and functional markers were also included in the panel. By applying dimensional reduction and computational unsupervised clustering approaches, we delineated in an unbiased fashion 132 phenotypically distinct subsets within the major immune cell populations. We were able to identify an effector memory Treg subset expressing HLA-DR, CCR4, CCR6, CXCR3, and GATA3 that was increased in the high-risk group. In addition, two subsets of NK cells defined by CD16+ CD8+ CXCR3+ and CD16+ CD8+ CXCR3+ CD11c+ were also higher in the same subjects. High-risk individuals did not show impaired glucose tolerance at the time of sampling, suggesting that the changes observed were not the result of metabolic imbalance, and might be potential biomarkers predictive of T1D."

Epub 2019 May 23.,Article has no keywords,"The pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) involves serial acquisition of mutations controlling several cellular processes, requiring combination therapies affecting key downstream survival nodes in order to treat the disease effectively. The BCL2 selective inhibitor venetoclax has potent anti-leukemia efficacy; however, resistance can occur due to its inability to inhibit MCL1, which is stabilized by the MAPK pathway. In this study, we aimed to determine the anti-leukemia efficacy of concomitant targeting of the BCL2 and MAPK pathways by venetoclax and the MEK1/2 inhibitor cobimetinib, respectively. The combination demonstrated synergy in seven of 11 AML cell lines, including those resistant to single agents, and showed growth-inhibitory activity in over 60% of primary samples from patients with diverse genetic alterations. The combination markedly impaired leukemia progenitor functions, while maintaining normal progenitors. Mass cytometry data revealed that BCL2 protein is enriched in leukemia stem/progenitor cells, primarily in venetoclax-sensitive samples, and that cobimetinib suppressed cytokine-induced pERK and pS6 signaling pathways. Through proteomic profiling studies, we identified several pathways inhibited downstream of MAPK that contribute to the synergy of the combination. In OCI-AML3 cells, the combination downregulated MCL1 protein levels and disrupted both BCL2:BIM and MCL1:BIM complexes, releasing BIM to induce cell death. RNA sequencing identified several enriched pathways, including MYC, mTORC1, and p53 in cells sensitive to the drug combination. In vivo, the venetoclax-cobimetinib combination reduced leukemia burden in xenograft models using genetically engineered OCI-AML3 and MOLM13 cells. Our data thus provide a rationale for combinatorial blockade of MEK and BCL2 pathways in AML."

Epub 2019 May 23.,Keywords: compensation; mass cytometry; spillover; unlabeled antibodies.,"Mass cytometry (MCM; CyTOF) utilizes isotopically purified metal-tagged antibodies for single-cell analysis and can analyze more than 40 parameters simultaneously with minimum signal spillover to other mass channels as compared to fluorescent flow cytometry. In spite of this improvement, various factors such as metal oxidation, abundance sensitivity related spillover, and metal impurities can cause measurable amounts of spillover in MCM that can potentially lead to misinterpretation of data. Linear spillover can be corrected by applying compensation; however, we demonstrate that at high signal intensities, MCM channel spillovers are frequently nonlinear. This report describes a simple method to correct for nonlinear signal spillover (due to abundance sensitivity, isotopic contamination, or oxide formation) that can occur at high signal intensity through the use of unlabeled competitor antibodies to the specific metal-tagged antibodies causing spillover. This method significantly decreased high signal intensity and nonlinear spillover to other mass channels while maintaining saturating antibody concentrations, thereby facilitating accurate staining and compensation. In contrast, the common method of using under-titrated antibodies to overcome spillover lead to staining intensity that varied with cell numbers and antigen abundance. We demonstrate that this technique reduces total signal without significantly altering immunophenotypic or functional measurement of relative antigen levels and could be used to enable improved linear compensation of signal spillovers from high abundance antigens. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Mass cytometry is becoming a well-established technology for comprehensive analysis of complex biological samples, due to its ability to enable measurement of more than 40 simultaneous parameters. Due to the use of isotopically pure metal-tagged antibodies, measurement channel spillover in mass cytometry is drastically lower than in fluorescent cytometry but can still occur due to metal oxidation, isotopic impurities, or abundance sensitivity when mass signals have high intensity. We show in this report that high abundance antigens with high signal intensity exhibit non-linear mass channel spillovers that cannot be easily compensated. We also demonstrate a simple method for the use of unlabeled competitor antibody to decrease antigen signal intensity while maintaining antigen abundance to allow for more accurate linear compensation. This method performs more consistently than the commonly used approach of using under-titrated antibodies. We believe that this report has immediate practical utility for researchers using mass cytometry and can be broadly utilized to enable compensation of mass cytometry data when needed. We thus feel that this article merits publication as a Brief Report in Cytometry Part A. © 2019 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry."

We previously developed a mass-cytometry-based single-cell proteomics approach that enables quantitative assessment of overexpression effects on cell signaling. Here, we applied this approach in a human kinome- and phosphatome-wide study to assess how 649 individually overexpressed proteins modulated cancer-related signaling in HEK293T cells in an abundance-dependent manner. Based on these data, we expanded the functional classification of human kinases and phosphatases and showed that the overexpression effects include non-catalytic roles. We detected 208 previously unreported signaling relationships. The signaling dynamics analysis indicated that the overexpression of ERK-specific phosphatases sustains proliferative signaling. This suggests a phosphatase-driven mechanism of cancer progression. Moreover, our analysis revealed a drug-resistant mechanism through which overexpression of tyrosine kinases, including SRC, FES, YES1, and BLK, induced MEK-independent ERK activation in melanoma A375 cells. These proteins could predict drug sensitivity to BRAF-MEK concurrent inhibition in cells carrying BRAF mutations."

Epub 2019 May 17.,Keywords: flow cytometry; mass cytometry; metric learning; microbiology; synthetic microbial communities; transfer learning.,"Recent years have seen an increased interest in employing data analysis techniques for the automated identification of cell populations in the field of cytometry. These techniques highly depend on the use of a distance metric, a function that quantifies the distances between single-cell measurements. In most cases, researchers simply use the Euclidean distance metric. In this article, we exploit the availability of single-cell labels to find an optimal Mahalanobis distance metric derived from the data. We show that such a Mahalanobis distance metric results in an improved identification of cell populations compared with the Euclidean distance metric. Once determined, it can be used for the analysis of multiple samples that were measured under the same experimental setup. We illustrate this approach for cytometry data from two different origins, that is, flow cytometry applied to microbial cells and mass cytometry for the analysis of human blood cells. We also illustrate that such a distance metric results in an improved identification of cell populations when clustering methods are employed. Generally, these results imply that the performance of data analysis techniques can be improved by using a more advanced distance metric. © 2019 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry."

As a consequence, the increasing number of parameters that can be detected simultaneously also introduces substantial complexity for the experimental setup and downstream data processing. However, this challenge in data analysis fostered the development of novel bioinformatic tools to fully exploit the high-dimensional data. These tools will eventually replace cumbersome serial, manual gating in the two-dimensional space driven by a priori knowledge, which still represents the gold standard in flow cytometric analysis, to meet the needs of the today's immunologist.

Long-lived hematopoietic stem cells give rise to early progenitors with multi-lineage potential that progressively differentiate into lineage-specific progenitors. Following lineage commitment, these progenitors proliferate and expand, before eventually differentiating into their mature forms. This process drives the up- and downregulation of a wide variety of surface and intracellular markers throughout differentiation, making cytometric analysis of this interconnected system challenging. Moreover, during inflammation, the hematopoietic system can be mobilized to re-prioritize the production of various lineages, in order to match increased demand, often at the expense of other lineages. As such, the response of the hematopoietic system in the bone marrow (BM) is a critical component of both immunity and disease. Because of the complexity of the hematopoietic system in steady state and disease, high-dimensional cytometry technologies are well suited to the exploration of these complex systems. Here we describe a protocol for the extraction of murine bone marrow, and preparation for examination using high-dimensional flow or mass cytometry. Additionally, we describe methods for performing cell cycle assays using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) or iododeoxyuridine (IdU).

Antibodies and other detection probes are coupled to elemental tags, each with a unique mass and detectable at single-cell resolution using an ICP-MS type of instrument. Given the sensitivity of the detection system, any free metal ions must be carefully removed through multiple rounds of washing in order to prevent background signal. This results in significant loss of cells. Together with cells lost during acquisition, the final data can represent as little as 10% of the starting material, seriously limiting the amount of information that can be extracted from small samples. Furthermore, complex staining protocols introduce experimental variations that limit comparisons across experiments. Here we present a cell processing and staining procedure for mass cytometry fully automated using a liquid handling robotic system and we present measures taken to optimize all steps of the protocol. These advances are applicable to both manual and automated protocols and provide a six-fold higher cell yield as compared to a standard protocol. With this increased yield and improved reproducibility this protocol now allows us to perform mass cytometry analysis using as little as 100 μL of whole blood as starting material."

For assays that require uncompromised profiling of cell-surface markers on live cells, barcoding by metal-labeled antibodies targeting cell-surface epitopes is the barcoding approach of choice. Here we provide an optimized and validated protocol for cell-surface barcoding of ten PBMC samples with palladium-labeled β2-microglobulin (B2M) antibodies used in a 5-choose-2 barcoding scheme, for subsequent immune phenotyping by mass cytometry. We further provide details on the generation of palladium-labeled antibodies utilizing amine-reactive isothiocyanobenzyl-EDTA (ITCB-EDTA) that permits the implementation of antibody-based barcoding not interfering with lanthanide channels typically used for analyte detection in mass cytometry assays."

This ability is intrinsic to the cDC2 lineage but tissue dependent for macrophages. We further show that human Tfh cells comprise two effector states producing either IL-21 or CXCL13. Distinct mechanisms drive the production of Tfh effector molecules, involving IL-12p70 for IL-21 and activin A and TGFβ for CXCL13. Finally, using imaging mass cytometry, we find that tonsil CD14+ macrophages localize in situ in the B cell follicles, where they can interact with Tfh cells. Our results indicate that human lymphoid organ cDC2 and macrophages play complementary roles in the induction of Tfh responses."

To develop better therapeutic strategies, understanding tumor microenvironmental factors that contribute to the treatment resistance is important. A major impediment to understanding disease mechanisms and improving therapy has been a lack of murine cell lines that resemble the aggressive and metastatic nature of human HNSCCs. Furthermore, a majority of murine models employ subcutaneous implantations of tumors which lack important physiological features of the head and neck region, including high vascular density, extensive lymphatic vasculature, and resident mucosal flora. The purpose of this study is to develop and characterize an orthotopic model of HNSCC. We employ two genetically distinct murine cell lines and established tumors in the buccal mucosa of mice. We optimize collagenase-based tumor digestion methods for the optimal recovery of single cells from established tumors. The data presented here show that mice develop highly vascularized tumors that metastasize to regional lymph nodes. Single-cell multiparametric mass cytometry analysis shows the presence of diverse immune populations with myeloid cells representing the majority of all immune cells. The model proposed in this study has applications in cancer biology, tumor immunology, and preclinical development of novel therapeutics.

The prevalence and impact of T cell exhaustion following organ transplantation, another immune stimulus with persistently high antigen load, are unknown. Here, we characterized serially collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 26 kidney transplant recipients using time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) to define distinct subsets of circulating exhausted T cells and their relationship to induction therapy and allograft function. We observed an increase in specific subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ exhausted T cells from pre-transplant to 6-months post-transplant, with greater increases in participants given anti-thymocyte globulin induction than in participants who received no induction or non-depleting induction. The percentages of exhausted T cells at 6 months correlated inversely with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production (a surrogate of T cell function) and with allograft interstitial fibrosis. Guided by the CyTOF data, we delineated a PD-1+CD57- phenotype for CD4+ and CD8+ exhausted T cells, and confirmed that these cells have limited capacity for cytokine secretion and ATP production. In an independent cohort of 50 kidney transplant recipients, we confirmed the predicted increase of PD-1+CD57- exhausted T cells after lymphocyte-depleting induction therapy and its direct correlation with better allograft function. Our findings suggest that monitoring T cell exhaustion can be useful for post-transplant risk assessment and support the need to develop and test strategies aimed at augmenting T cell exhaustion following kidney transplantation."

Different phenotypes and functions have been ascribed to rodent microglia, but little is known about human microglia (huMG) heterogeneity. Difficulties in procuring huMG and their susceptibility to cryopreservation damage have limited large-scale studies.

However, we lack a detailed spatiotemporal map of these events due to our inability to track the fate of cells between anatomically distinct locations or functionally identify cell populations as migratory. We used photo-convertible transgenic mice (Kaede) to spatiotemporally track the fate and composition of the cell populations that leave the site of priming and enter the draining lymph node to initiate immunity. We show that following skin priming, the lymph node migratory population is principally composed of cells recruited to the site of priming, with a minor contribution from tissue resident cells. In combination with the YAe/Eα system, we also show that the majority of cells presenting antigen are CD103+CD11b+ dendritic cells that were recruited to the site of priming during the inflammatory response. This population has previously only been described in relation to mucosal tissues. Comprehensive phenotypic profiling of the cells migrating from the skin to the draining lymph node by mass cytometry revealed that in addition to dendritic cells, the migratory population also included CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and neutrophils. Taking our complex spatiotemporal data set, we then generated a model of cell migration that quantifies and describes the dynamics of arrival, departure, and residence times of cells at the site of priming and in the draining lymph node throughout the time-course of the initiation of adaptive immunity. In addition, we have identified the mean migration time of migratory dendritic cells as they travel from the site of priming to the draining lymph node. These findings represent an unprecedented, detailed and quantitative map of cell dynamics and phenotypes during immunization, identifying where, when and which cells to target for immunomodulation in autoimmunity and vaccination strategies."

Understanding how the host response to premalignancy is maintained and altered during malignant transformation is needed to prevent cancer. In order to understand the immune microenvironment in precursor monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and myeloma, we analyzed bone marrow immune cells from 12 healthy donors and 26 MGUS/myeloma patients by mass cytometry and concurrently profiled transcriptomes of 42,606 single immune cells from these bone marrows. Compared to age-matched healthy donors, memory T cells from both MGUS and myeloma patients exhibit greater terminal-effector differentiation. However, memory T cells in MGUS show greater enrichment of stem-like TCF1/7hi cells. Clusters of T cells with stem-like and tissue-residence genes were also found to be enriched in MGUS by single-cell transcriptome analysis. Early changes in both NK and myeloid cells were also observed in MGUS. Enrichment of stem-like T cells correlated with a distinct genomic profile of myeloid cells and levels of Dickkopf-1 in bone-marrow plasma. These data describe the landscape of changes in both innate and adaptive immunity in premalignancy and suggest that attrition of the bone-marrow-resident T cell compartment due to loss of stem-like cells may underlie loss of immune surveillance in myeloma."

In MC, antibodies (Abs) are tagged with heavy metal isotopes via conjugation to metal chelating polymers (MCPs). To improve the sensitivity of MC towards low abundance biomarkers, we are developing nanoparticle (NP)-based reagents as mass tags for Abs. We examine the use of silica-coated NaHoF4 NPs (d ∼ 12 nm) decorated with PEG5k conjugated to thiol-modified primary or secondary Abs for MC assays. We compare the sensitivity of NP-Ab conjugates to MCP-Ab conjugates towards seven biomarkers with varying expression levels across six cell lines. We also perform a multi-parameter assay using a cocktail of both NP- and MCP-based reagents to detect seven cellular markers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In the case of highly abundant markers, signal enhancements from NP-Ab conjugates offer minimal advantages over MCP-Ab conjugates, which already give strong signals. In the case of biomarkers with lower abundance, the level of signal enhancements depended on the nature of the biomarker being detected, or on the type of detection method used. When comparing the indirect detection of CD14 on THP-1 cells using NPs or MCPs conjugated to secondary Abs, the NP reagents offered little signal enhancements compared to the MCP reagents. However, in the case of direct CD14 detection on THP-1 or U937 cells using NPs or MCPs conjugated to primary Abs, a 30- or 450-fold signal enhancement was seen from the NP-based reagent. In the experiments where both NP-Ab and MCP-Ab conjugates were used together to stain PBMCs, we found that the presence of the NP-Ab conjugates did not affect the function of MCP-Ab conjugates, and the NP-Ab conjugates showed minimal non-specific interaction with cells without the target biomarker (CD14). Furthermore, these NP-Ab conjugates could be used to identify rare CD14+ monocytes from the PBMC mixture with a 20-fold signal increase when compared to the use of only MCP-Ab conjugates. Collectively, the strong signal amplification obtained from NP reagents demonstrate the potential of these reagents to be used in conjunction with MCP-reagents to detect rare cellular markers or cell types that may otherwise be overlooked when using MCP-reagents alone."

We demonstrate the utility of osmium-labeled beads for signal spillover compensation in mass cytometry, and, strikingly, their application in quantitative Ab-binding capacity assays combined with high-dimensional profiling of human PBMC enabled the systematic assessment of receptor expression profiles across large numbers of cellular phenotypes. This analysis confirmed increased monocytic Siglec-1 expression in active systemic lupus erythematosus patients and, additionally, revealed interrelated reductions of CD4 expression by regulatory and memory CD4 T cells and HLA-DR expression by myeloid dendritic cells, pointing toward defective cross-talk at the immunological synapse that may limit immune responses in systemic lupus erythematosus.

The expression of 73 proteins in 26 million cells was evaluated using tumor and immune cell-centric antibody panels. Tumors displayed individuality in tumor cell composition, including phenotypic abnormalities and phenotype dominance. Relationship analyses between tumor and immune cells revealed characteristics of ecosystems related to immunosuppression and poor prognosis. High frequencies of PD-L1+ tumor-associated macrophages and exhausted T cells were found in high-grade ER+ and ER- tumors.

TePhe labeling is competitive with phenylalanine but not other large and aromatic amino acids, demonstrating its molecular specificity as a phenylalanine mimic; labeling is also abrogated in vitro and in vivo by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, validating TePhe as a translation reporter. In vivo, imaging mass cytometry with TePhe visualizes translation dynamics in the mouse gut, brain, and tumor.

Healthy peripheral blood and bone marrow cells are stained with a pre-optimized ""backbone"" antibody panel in addition to the progressively diluted (titrated) antibodies. Clustering based on the backbone panel enables the titration of each antibody against a rich hematopoietic background and assures that nonspecific binding and signal spillover can be quantified accurately. Using a slightly expanded backbone panel, antibodies quantifying changes in transcription factors and phosphorylated antigens are titrated on ex vivo stimulated cells to optimize sensitivity and evaluate baseline expression. Based on this information, complex panels of antibodies can be thoroughly optimized for use on healthy whole blood and bone marrow and are easily adaptable to the investigation of samples from for example clinical studies. © 2019 The Authors.

Typhi). The oral live attenuated Ty21a typhoid vaccine protects against this severe disease by eliciting robust, multifunctional cell-mediated immunity (CMI), shown to be associated with protection in wild-type S. Typhi challenge studies. Ty21a induces S. Typhi-responsive CD8+ and CD4+ T cells but little is known about the response to this vaccine in children. To address this important gap in knowledge, we have used mass cytometry to analyze pediatric and adult pre- and post-Ty21a vaccination CMI in an autologous S. Typhi antigen presentation model. Here, using conventional supervised analytical tools, we show adult T cells are more multifunctional at baseline than those obtained from children. Moreover, pediatric and adult T cells respond similarly to Ty21a vaccination, but adult responders remain more multifunctional. The use of the unsupervised dimensionality reduction tool tSNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) allowed us to confirm these findings, as well as to identify increases and decreases in well-defined specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell populations that were not possible to uncover using the conventional gating strategies. These findings evidenced age-associated maturation of multifunctional S. Typhi-responsive T-cell populations, including those which we have previously shown to be associated with protection from, and/or delayed onset of, typhoid disease. These findings are likely to play an important role in improving pediatric vaccination strategies against S. Typhi and other enteric pathogens."

We performed a 1-year prospective study in patients treated for acute P. falciparum malaria for the first time, or with previous exposure to the disease. Using an unbiased exploratory approach with mass cytometry, followed by targeted flow cytometry, we found that ~80% of mature B cells that proliferated in response to acute infection expressed CD11c. Only ~40% of CD11c+ B cells displayed an atypical B cell phenotype, with the remaining cells primarily made up of activated- and resting memory B cells. The CD11c+ B cells expanded rapidly following infection, with previous exposure to malaria resulting in a significantly larger increase compared to individuals with primary infection. This was attributed to an expansion of switched CD11c+ B cells that was absent in primary infected individuals. The rate of contraction of the CD11c+ B cell compartment was independent of previous exposure to malaria and displayed a slow decay with a half-life of ~300 days. Collectively, these results identify CD11c as a marker of B cells responding to malaria and further highlight differences in primary- and secondary B cell responses during infection."

CTLA-4 imposes major boundaries on CD4+ T cell phenotypes, whereas PD-1 subtly limits CD8+ T cell phenotypes. By computationally reconstructing T cell differentiation paths, we identified protein expression changes that underlied the abnormal phenotypic expansion and pinpointed when lineage choice events occurred during differentiation. Similar alterations in T cell phenotypes were observed after anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 antibody blockade. These findings implicate negative co-stimulation as a key regulator and determinant of T cell differentiation and suggest that checkpoint blockade might work in part by altering the limits of T cell phenotypes."

The immune system may have a role in seizure and epilepsy development, but the specific mechanisms of inflammation that lead to epileptogenesis and contribute to RE are unknown. Here, we used mass cytometry to comprehensively study the immune system of pediatric patients with RE and compared their immune profile and function with patients with age-matched autoimmune encephalitis (AIE) and healthy controls. Patients with RE and AIE displayed similar immune profiles overall, with changes in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets and an unbalance toward pro-inflammatory IL-17 production. In addition, patients with RE uniquely showed an altered balance in natural killer cell subsets. A systems level intercellular network analysis identified rewiring of the immune system leading to loss of inhibitory/regulatory intercellular connections and emergence of pro-inflammatory pathogenic functions in neuro-inflammatory immune-cell networks in patients with AIE and RE. These data underscore the contribution of systemic inflammation to the pathogenesis of seizures and epileptogenesis and have direct translational implications in advancing diagnostics and therapeutics design."

Despite consistent evidence of B lineage cells in the mucosa in IBD, little is known of B cell recruitment to the gut in IBD. Here we analyzed B cells in blood of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) with a range of disease activities. We analyzed the frequencies of known B cell subsets in blood and observed a consistent reduction in the proportion of CD27-IgD- B cells expressing all Ig isotypes in the blood in IBD (independent of severity of disease and treatment) compared to healthy controls. Successful treatment of patients with biologic therapies did not change the profile of B cell subsets in blood. By mass cytometry we demonstrated that CD27-IgD- B cells were proportionately enriched in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) in IBD. Since production of TNFα is a feature of IBD relevant to therapies, we sought to determine whether B cells in GALT or the CD27-IgD- subset in particular could contribute to pathology by secretion of TNFα or IL-10. We found that donor matched GALT and blood B cells are capable of producing TNFα as well as IL-10, but we saw no evidence that CD27-IgD- B cells from blood expressed more TNFα compared to other subsets. The reduced proportion of CD27-IgD- B cells in blood and the increased proportion in the gut implies that CD27-IgD- B cells are recruited from the blood to the gut in IBD. CD27-IgD- B cells have been implicated in immune responses to intestinal bacteria and recruitment to GALT, and may contribute to the intestinal inflammatory milieu in IBD."

While it has long been known that sepsis deeply perturbs immune homeostasis by inducing a tremendous systemic inflammatory response, pivotal observations based on clinical flow cytometry indicate that sepsis indeed initiates a more complex immune response that varies over time, with the concomitant occurrence of both pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. As a resultant, some septic patients enter a stage of protracted immunosuppression. This paved the way for immunostimulation approaches in sepsis. Clinical flow cytometry permitted this evolution by drawing a new picture of pathophysiology and reshaping immune trajectories in patients. Additional information from cytometry by time of flight mass cytometry and other high-dimensional flow cytometry platform should rapidly enrich our understanding of this complex disease. This review reports on landmarks of clinical flow cytometry in sepsis and how this single-cell analysis technique permitted to breach the wall of decades of unfruitful anti-inflammatory-based clinical trials in sepsis. © 2019 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry."

Multiparametric phenotyping by mass cytometry extended possibilities for immunoprofiling. However, careful optimization of each step of such method is necessary for obtaining reliable results. Also, with respect to procedure length and costs, sample preparation, staining, and storage should be optimized. Here, we designed a panel of 31 antibodies which allows for identification of several subpopulations of lymphoid and myeloid cells in a solid tumor and peripheral blood simultaneously. For sample preparation, disaggregation of tumor tissue with two different collagenases combined with DNase I was compared, and removal of dead or tumor cells by magnetic separation was evaluated. Two possible procedures of barcoding for single-tube staining of several samples were examined. While the palladium-based barcoding affected the stability of several antigens, the staining with two differently labeled CD45 antibodies was suitable for cells isolated from a patient's blood and tumor. The storage of samples in the intercalation solution for up to two weeks did not influence results of the analysis, which allowed the measurement of samples collected within this interval on the same day. This procedure optimized on samples from patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma enabled identification of various immune cells including rare subpopulations."

Typhi) is the causative agent of typhoid fever-a life-threatening disease of great global health significance, particularly in the developing world. Ty21a is an oral live-attenuated vaccine that protects against the development of typhoid disease in part by inducing robust T cell responses, among which multifunctional CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) play an important role. Following Ty21a vaccination, a significant component of adult CTL have shown to be targeted to S. Typhi antigen presented by the conserved major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class Ib molecule, human leukocyte antigen-E (HLA-E). S. Typhi challenge studies have shown that baseline, multifunctional HLA-E responsive T cells are associated with protection from, and delayed onset of, typhoid disease. However, despite the overwhelming burden of typhoid fever in school-aged children, and due to limited availability of pediatric samples, incomplete information is available regarding these important HLA-E-restricted responses in children, even though studies have shown that younger children may be less likely to develop protective cell mediated immune (CMI) responses than adults following vaccination. To address this gap, we have studied this phenomenon in depth by using mass cytometry to analyze pediatric and adult T cell responses to HLA-E-restricted S. Typhi antigen presentation, before and after Ty21a vaccination. Herein, we show variable responses in all age strata following vaccination among T effector memory (TEM) and T effector memory CD45RA+ (TEMRA) cells based on conventional gating analysis. However, by utilizing the dimensionality reduction tool tSNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), we are able to identify diverse, highly multifunctional gut-homing- TEM and TEMRA clusters of cells which are more abundant in adult and older pediatric participants than in younger children. These findings highlight a potential age-associated maturation of otherwise conserved HLA-E restricted T cell responses. Such insights, coupled with the marked importance of multifunctional T cell responses to combat infection, may better inform future pediatric vaccination strategies against S. Typhi and other infectious diseases."

Proposed models of hematopoiesis suggest that quantitative changes in lineage-specific transcription factors (LS-TFs) underlie cell-fate decisions. However, evidence for such models is lacking as TF levels are typically measured via RNA expression rather than by analyzing temporal changes in protein abundance. Here, we used single-cell mass cytometry and absolute quantification by mass spectrometry to capture the temporal dynamics of TF protein expression in individual cells during human erythropoiesis. We found that LS-TFs from alternate lineages are co-expressed, as proteins, in individual early progenitor cells and quantitative changes of LS-TFs occur gradually rather than abruptly to direct cell-fate decisions. Importantly, upregulation of a megakaryocytic TF in early progenitors is sufficient to deviate cells from an erythroid to a megakaryocyte trajectory, showing that quantitative changes in protein abundance of LS-TFs in progenitors can determine alternate cell fates."

In contrast, mass cytometry can resolve more signals by exploiting lanthanide-tagged antibodies; however, only about 100 metal reporters can be attached to an antibody molecule. This makes the sensitivity of lanthanide-tagged antibodies substantially lower than fluorescent reporters. A new probe that can carry more lanthanide molecules per antibody is a desirable way to enhance the sensitivity needed for the detection of protein with low cellular abundance. Herein, we report on the development of new probes utilizing mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs) with hydroxyl, amine, or phosphonate functional groups. The phosphonated MSNPs proved to be best at loading lanthanides for up to 1.4 × 10⁶ molecules per particle, and could be loaded with various lanthanide elements (Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Yb, and Lu) at relatively similar molar extents. The modified MSNPs can also load a fluorescent dye, allowing bimodal mass and fluorescence-based detection. We achieved specificity of antibody-conjugated nanoparticles (at 1.4 × 10³ antibodies per nanoparticle) for targeting proteins on the cell surface. The new materials can potentially be used as mass cytometry probes and provide a method for simultaneous monitoring of a large host of factors comprising the tumor microenvironment (e.g., extracellular matrix, cancer cells, and immune cells). These novel probes may also benefit personalized medicine by allowing for high-throughput analysis of multiple proteins in the same specimen."

Epub 2019 Mar 12.,Keywords: cell population prediction; machine learning; mass cytometry; single cell.,"Mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) is a valuable technology for high-dimensional analysis at the single cell level. Identification of different cell populations is an important task during the data analysis. Many clustering tools can perform this task, which is essential to identify ""new"" cell populations in explorative experiments. However, relying on clustering is laborious since it often involves manual annotation, which significantly limits the reproducibility of identifying cell-populations across different samples. The latter is particularly important in studies comparing different conditions, for example in cohort studies. Learning cell populations from an annotated set of cells solves these problems. However, currently available methods for automatic cell population identification are either complex, dependent on prior biological knowledge about the populations during the learning process, or can only identify canonical cell populations. We propose to use a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier to automatically identify cell populations in CyTOF data. LDA outperforms two state-of-the-art algorithms on four benchmark datasets. Compared to more complex classifiers, LDA has substantial advantages with respect to the interpretable performance, reproducibility, and scalability to larger datasets with deeper annotations. We apply LDA to a dataset of ~3.5 million cells representing 57 cell populations in the Human Mucosal Immune System. LDA has high performance on abundant cell populations as well as the majority of rare cell populations, and provides accurate estimates of cell population frequencies. Further incorporating a rejection option, based on the estimated posterior probabilities, allows LDA to identify previously unknown (new) cell populations that were not encountered during training. Altogether, reproducible prediction of cell population compositions using LDA opens up possibilities to analyze large cohort studies based on CyTOF data. © 2019 The Authors.

Stroke produces profound local and systemic immune responses that engage all major innate and adaptive immune compartments. However, whether the systemic immune response to stroke contributes to long-term disability remains ill-defined. We used a single-cell mass cytometry approach to comprehensively and functionally characterize the systemic immune response to stroke in longitudinal blood samples from 24 patients over the course of 1 year and correlated the immune response with changes in cognitive functioning between 90 and 365 days post-stroke. Using elastic net regularized regression modelling, we identified key elements of a robust and prolonged systemic immune response to ischaemic stroke that occurs in three phases: an acute phase (Day 2) characterized by increased signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signalling responses in innate immune cell types, an intermediate phase (Day 5) characterized by increased cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) signalling responses in adaptive immune cell types, and a late phase (Day 90) by persistent elevation of neutrophils, and immunoglobulin M+ (IgM+) B cells. By Day 365 there was no detectable difference between these samples and those from an age- and gender-matched patient cohort without stroke. When regressed against the change in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores between Days 90 and 365 after stroke, the acute inflammatory phase Elastic Net model correlated with post-stroke cognitive trajectories (r = -0.692, Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.039). The results demonstrate the utility of a deep immune profiling approach with mass cytometry for the identification of clinically relevant immune correlates of long-term cognitive trajectories."

Epub 2019 Mar 11.,Keywords: barcoding; mass cytometry; ratiometry.,"Mass cytometry (CyTOF) is a critical cell profiling tool in acquiring multiparameter proteome data at the single-cell level. A major challenge in CyTOF analysis is sample-to-sample variance arising from the pipetting process, staining variation, and instrument sensitivity. To reduce such variations, cell barcoding strategies that enable the combination of individual samples prior to antibody staining and data acquisition on CyTOF are often utilized. The most prevalent barcoding strategy is based on a binary scheme that cross-examines the existence or nonexistence of certain mass signals; however, it is limited by low barcoding efficiency and high cost, especially for large sample size. Herein, we present a novel barcoding method for CyTOF application based on mass ratiometry. Different mass tags with specific fixed ratios are used to label CD45 antibody to achieve sample barcoding. The presented method exponentially increases the number of possible barcoded samples with the same amount of mass tags compared with conventional methods. It also reduces the overall time for the labeling process to 40 min and avoids the need for expensive commercial barcoding buffer reagents. Moreover, unlike the conventional barcoding process, this strategy does not pre-permeabilize cells before the barcoding procedure, which offers additional benefits in preserving surface biomarker signals."

MSI of individual cells (of a known cell type) affords a unique insight into normal and disease-related processes and is a prerequisite for combining the results of MSI and other single-cell modalities (e.g. mass cytometry and next-generation sequencing). Technological barriers have prevented the high-throughput assignment of MSI spectra from solid tissue preparations to their cell type. These barriers include obtaining a suitable cell-identifying image (e.g. immunohistochemistry) and obtaining sufficiently accurate registration of the cell-identifying and MALDI-MS images. This study introduces a technique that overcame these barriers by assigning cell type directly from mass spectra. We hypothesized that, in MSI from mice with a defined fluorescent protein expression pattern, the fluorescent protein's molecular ion could be used to identify cell cohorts. A method was developed for the purification of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) from mice. To determine EYFP's molecular mass for MSI studies, we performed intact mass analysis and characterized the protein's primary structure and post-translational modifications through various techniques. MALDI-MSI methods were developed to enhance the detection of EYFP in situ, and by extraction of EYFP's molecular ion from MALDI-MS images, automated, whole-image assignment of cell cohorts was achieved. This method was validated using a well-characterized mouse line that expresses EYFP in motor and sensory neurons and should be applicable to hundreds of commercially available mice (and other animal) strains comprising a multitude of cell-specific fluorescent labels."

Here, differences in CD40 expression and signaling responses were compared across differentiation stages of mature human tonsillar B cells. A combination of mass cytometry and phospho-specific flow cytometry was used to quantify protein expression and CD40L-induced signaling in primary human naïve, GC, and memory B cells. Protein expression signatures of cell subsets were quantified using viSNE and Marker Enrichment Modeling (MEM). This approach revealed enriched expression of CD40 protein in GC B cells, compared to naïve and memory B cells. Despite this, GC B cells responded to CD40L engagement with lower phosphorylation of NFκB p65 during the first 30 min following CD40L activation. Before CD40L stimulation, GC B cells expressed higher levels of suppressor protein IκBα than naïve and memory B cells. Following CD40 activation, IκBα was rapidly degraded and reached equivalently low levels in naïve, GC, and memory B cells at 30 min following CD40L. Quantifying CD40 signaling responses as a function of bound ligand revealed a correlation between bound CD40L and degree of induced NFκB p65 phosphorylation, whereas comparable IκBα degradation occurred at all measured levels of CD40L binding.

Certain phenotypic changes induced by the prime were maintained over time and, as a result, the NK cell composition prior to boost differed from that before prime. The key phenotypic signature that distinguished NK cells responding to the boost from those responding to the prime included stronger expression of several cytotoxic, homing, and adhesion molecules, suggesting that NK cells at recall were functionally distinct.

Using mass cytometry, we identified at least 12 subsets of intratumoral CD4+ T cells, 3 of which were unique to FL biopsies versus control tissues. Of these subsets, the frequency of naive T cells correlated with improved patient survival. Although total PD-1+ T cell numbers were not associated with patient outcome, specific PD-1+ T cell subpopulations were associated with poor survival. Intratumoral T cells lacking CD27 and CD28 co-stimulatory receptor expression were enriched in FL and correlated with inferior patient outcomes. In vitro models revealed that CD70+ lymphoma cells played an important role in expanding this population. Taken together, our mass cytometry results identified CD4+ memory T cell populations that are poorly functional due to loss of co-stimulatory receptor expression and are associated with an inferior survival in FL."

Epub 2019 Feb 19.,Keywords: Magnetic flow cytometry; Magnetic particles; Magnetic sensors; Microfluidics; Point-of-care.,"The growing need for biological information at the single cell level has driven the development of improved cytometry technologies. Flow cytometry is a particularly powerful method that has evolved over the past few decades. Flow cytometers have become essential instruments in biomedical research and routine clinical tests for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring. However, the increasing number of cellular parameters unveiled by genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data platforms demands an augmented multiplexability. Also, the need for identification and quantification of relevant biomarkers at low levels requires outstanding analytical sensitivity and reliability. In addition, growing awareness of the advantages associated with miniaturization of analytical devices is pushing forward the progress in integrated and compact, microfluidic-based devices at the point-of-care. In this context, novel types of flow cytometers are emerging during the search to tackle these challenges. Notwithstanding the relevance of other promising alternatives to standard optical flow cytometry (e.g., mass cytometry, various optical and electrical microcytometers), this report focuses on a recent microcytometric technology based on magnetic sensors and magnetic particles integrated into microfluidic structures for dynamic bioanalysis of fluid samples-magnetic flow cytometry. Its concept, main developments, targeted applications, as well as the challenges and trends behind this technology are presented and discussed.

Epub 2019 Feb 14.,Keywords: Biological tissue; Cy-TOF; Nano-SIMS; Nanoparticle analysis; Single-particle ICP-MS.,"The need to assess the human and environmental risks of nanoparticles (NPs) has prompted an adaptation of existing techniques and the development of new ones. Nanoparticle analysis poses a great challenge as the analytical information has to consider both physical (e.g. size and shape) and chemical (e.g. elemental composition) state of the analyte. Furthermore, one has to contemplate the transformation of NPs during the sample preparation and provide sufficient information about the new species derived from such alteration. Traditional techniques commonly used for NP analysis such as microscopy and light scattering are still frequently used for NPs in simple matrices; however, they have limitations in the analysis of complex environmental and biological samples. On the other hand, recent improvements in data acquisition frequencies and reduction of settling time of ICP-MS brought inorganic mass spectrometry into the forefront of NPs analysis. However, with the increasing demand of analytical information related to NPs, emerging techniques such as enhanced darkfield hyperspectral imaging, nano-SIMS and mass cytometry are in their way to fill the gaps. This trend review presents and discusses the state-of-the-art analytical techniques and sample preparation methods for NP analysis in biological matrices. Graphical abstract ᅟ."

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were also isolated from blood collected at the time of the surgery. Cells were immunostained with a panel of 20 antibody markers, and analyzed by mass cytometry. To identify and quantify the immune cell types in the samples, an unbiased clustering method was applied to the entire data set. More than 85 percent of the CD45+ cells isolated from resected RE brain tissue comprised T cells; by contrast NK cells and myeloid cells constituted 80-95 percent of the CD45+ cells isolated from the TSC and the FCD brain specimens. Three populations of myeloid cells made up >50 percent of all of the myeloid cells in all of the samples of which a population of HLA-DR+ CD11b+ CD4- cells comprised the vast majority of myeloid cells in the BIL fractions from the FCD and TSC cases. CD45RA+ HLA-DR- CD11b+ CD16+ NK cells constituted the major population of NK cells in the blood from all of the cases. This subset also comprised the majority of NK cells in BILs from the resected RE and HME brain tissue, whereas NK cells defined as CD45RA- HLA-DR+ CD11b- CD16- cells comprised 86-96 percent of the NK cells isolated from the FCD and TSC brain tissue. Thirteen different subsets of CD4 and CD8 αβ T cells and γδ T cells accounted for over 80% of the CD3+ T cells in all of the BIL and PBMC samples. At least 90 percent of the T cells in the RE BILs, 80 percent of the T cells in the HME BILs and 40-66 percent in the TSC and FCD BILs comprised activated antigen-experienced (CD45RO+ HLA-DR+ CD69+) T cells. We conclude that even in cases where there is no evidence for an infection or an immune disorder, activated peripheral immune cells may be present in epileptogenic areas of the brain, possibly in response to seizure-driven brain inflammation."

The detection of targets for phagocytosis is directed by a complex repertoire of cell surface receptors. Pattern recognition receptors directly detect targets for binding and uptake, while opsonic and complement receptors detect objects coated by soluble factors. However, the importance of single and combinatorial surface marker expression across different phenotypes of professional phagocytes is not known. Here we developed a novel mass cytometry-based phagocytosis assay that enables the simultaneous detection of phagocytic events in combination with up to 40 other protein markers. We applied this assay to distinct monocyte derived macrophage (MDM) populations and found that prototypic M2-like MDMs phagocytose more E. coli than M1-like MDMs. Surface markers such as CD14, CD206, and CD163 rendered macrophages phagocytosis competent, but only CD209 directly correlated with the amount of particle uptake. Similarly, M2-like MDMs also phagocytosed more cancer cells than M1-like MDMs but, unlike M1-like MDMs, were insensitive to anti-CD47 opsonization. Our approach facilitates the simultaneous study of single-cell phenotypes, phagocytic activity, signaling and transcriptional events in complex cell mixtures."

In the present study, we examined whole lymphocyte subsets and signal transduction proteins using high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry and a bioinformatics pipeline for an in-depth characterization of the immune cell subsets and protein profiles involved in pathways in the peripheral blood of patients with PS. We identified 15 major immune cell populations in T cell lineages and characterized various CD3+CD4+ Th and CD3+CD8+ T cytotoxic cell populations simultaneously across 24 leukocyte markers and 7 proteins related to the signal transduction pathways. High-dimensional analysis identified 3 new subsets that are abundant in PS peripheral blood, resembling CD3-CD4+ lymphoid tissue inducer cells, Tc17 cells, and CD8+CXCR3+ Tregs. We confirmed the CD3-CD4+ cells, and their features and functions, in an independent PS cohort. The use of single-cell mass cytometry allows systemic-level characterization of lymphocyte subpopulations and dysregulated signaling pathways in the blood of patients with PS, identifying abnormalities of different immune cell subsets. We validated that the CD3-CD4+ cells had elevated OX40 and decreased FRA2 expression, which were positively associated with the PS area and severity index."

Using 23 markers, we defined groups of proteins controlled predominantly by division state or time and found that undivided cells account for the majority of phenotypic diversity. We next built a map of cell state changes during naive T-cell expansion. By examining cell signaling on this map, we rationally selected ibrutinib, a BTK and ITK inhibitor, and administered it before T cell activation to direct differentiation toward a T stem cell memory (TSCM)-like phenotype. This method for tracing cell fate across division states and time can be broadly applied for directing cellular differentiation."

During chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (CHB), T cell responses are blunted with low frequencies of virus-specific T cells observed, making these parameters difficult to study. Here, using mass cytometry and a highly multiplexed combinatorial peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) tetramer strategy that allows for the detection of rare antigen-specific T cells, we simultaneously probed 484 unique HLA-A*1101-restricted epitopes spanning the entire HBV genome on T cells from patients at various stages of CHB. Numerous HBV-specific T cell populations were detected, validated, and profiled. T cells specific for two epitopes (HBVpol387 and HBVcore169) displayed differing and complex heterogeneities that were associated with the disease progression, and the expression of inhibitory receptors on these cells was not linearly related with their extent of T cell dysfunction. For HBVcore169-specific CD8+ T cells, we found cellular markers associated with long-term memory, polyfunctionality, and the presence of several previously unidentified public TCR clones that correlated with viral control. Using high-dimensional trajectory analysis of these cellular phenotypes, a pseudo-time metric was constructed that fit with the status of viral infection in corresponding patients. This was validated in a longitudinal cohort of patients undergoing antiviral therapy. Our study uncovers complex relationships of inhibitory receptors between the profiles of antigen-specific T cells and the status of CHB with implications for new strategies of therapeutic intervention."

RNA within single cells can be analyzed using unbiased sequencing protocols or through more targeted approaches using in situ hybridization (ISH). The proximity ligation assay for RNA (PLAYR) approach is a sensitive and high-throughput technique that relies on in situ and proximal ligation to measure at least 27 specific RNAs by flow or mass cytometry. We provide detailed instructions for combining this technique with antibody-based detection of surface/internal protein, allowing simultaneous highly multiplexed profiling of RNA and protein expression at single-cell resolution. PLAYR overcomes limitations on multiplexing seen in previous branching DNA-based RNA detection techniques by integration of a transcript-specific oligonucleotide sequence within a rolling-circle amplification (RCA). This unique transcript-associated sequence can then be detected by heavy metal (for mass cytometry)- or fluorophore (for flow cytometry)-conjugated complementary detection oligonucleotides. Included in this protocol is methodology to label oligonucleotides with lanthanide metals for use in mass cytometry. When analyzed by mass cytometry, up to 40 variables (with scope for future expansion) can be measured simultaneously. We used the described protocol to demonstrate intraclonal heterogeneity within primary cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, but it can be adapted to other primary cells or cell lines in suspension. This robust, reliable and reproducible protocol can be completed in 2-3 d and can be paused at several stages for convenience."

Using this method, we analyzed a large number of markers on millions of individual immune cells. The results revealed that CD4+ T cell clusters with high expression of CD27, CD28, CD127, and CD44, whose function involves T cell migration to inflamed tissues and survival, are more abundant in healthy controls and patients initiating ART during the acute phase; on the contrary, CD4+ T cell clusters in patients initiating ART during the chronic phase had reduced expression of these markers. The results are suggestive of a better preserved immune function in HIV-1-infected patients initiating ART during acute infection."

In this study, cytokine overproduction was examined in MF patient plasma and in MF blood cells ex vivo using mass cytometry. Plasma cytokines measured following treatment with ruxolitinib remained markedly abnormal, indicating that aberrant cytokine production persists despite therapeutic JAK2 inhibition. In MF patient samples, 14/15 cytokines measured by mass cytometry were found to be constitutively overproduced, with the principal cellular source for most cytokines being monocytes, implicating a non-cell-autonomous role for monocyte-derived cytokines impacting disease-propagating stem/progenitor cells in MF. The majority of cytokines elevated in MF exhibited ex vivo hypersensitivity to thrombopoietin (TPO), toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, and/or tumor necrosis factor (TNF). A subset of this group (including TNF, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10) was minimally sensitive to ruxolitinib. All TPO/TLR/TNF-sensitive cytokines, however, were sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition of NFκB and/or MAP kinase signaling.

Epub 2019 Feb 4.,Keywords: Cadmium; Glutathione; Hepatic stellate cell activation; Oxidative stress.,"The liver is a major organ involved in cadmium (Cd)-induced oxidative damage. Following liver injury, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are activated to participate in the wound healing process, but also facilitate liver fibrosis. Previous studies have observed fibrogenic effects of Cd on liver. However, the oxidative stress mechanisms of Cd-induced HSC activation as well as whether administration of glutathione (GSH) alleviates this activation, remain unclear. In this study, 24 rats were divided randomly into four experimental groups: control, GSH-treated, Cd-treated, and Cd + GSH-treated. After 4 weeks, the liver injury index, HSC-specific activation markers, oxidative stress-related antioxidants, and enzyme activities and signals were measured. Cd uptake and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in hepatocytes were detected by mass cytometry and fluorescence microscopy, respectively. Levels of aspartate aminotransferase, xanthine oxidase, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, and α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) were significantly increased in Cd-treated rats. Activated HSCs positive for αSMA expression and excess collagen deposition were detected in the Cd-treated group. In contrast, activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase were reduced. Supplementation with GSH reversed some of the Cd-induced effects and increased the protein level of phosphorylated (p)-P65 while decreasing p-JNK. Pretreatment with GSH lowered Cd uptake and ROS generation in hepatocytes in vitro. These results indicate that administration of GSH was effective in attenuating Cd-induced oxidative stress via decreasing Cd uptake, restoring the activities of oxidative enzymes, activating NF-κB, inhibiting the JNK signaling pathway, and preventing excessive ROS generation and HSC activation."

Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) enables multiplexed assessment of the abundance and localization of more than 30 proteins on the same tissue section at 1-μm resolution. Herein, we have developed a panel of 33 antibodies that allows for the quantification of key cell types including pancreatic exocrine cells, islet cells, immune cells, and stromal components. We employed this panel to analyze 12 pancreata obtained from donors with clinically diagnosed T1D and 6 pancreata from non-diabetic controls. In the pancreata from donors with T1D, we simultaneously visualized significant alterations in islet architecture, endocrine cell composition, and immune cell presentation. Indeed, we demonstrate the utility of IMC to investigate complex events on the cellular level that will provide new insights on the pathophysiology of T1D."

IMC enabled simultaneous measurement of 35 biomarkers with single-cell and spatial resolution. We performed pseudotime analysis of islets through T1D progression from snapshot data to reconstruct the evolution of β cell loss and insulitis. Our analyses revealed that β cell destruction is preceded by a β cell marker loss and by recruitment of cytotoxic and helper T cells. The approaches described herein demonstrate the value of IMC for improving our understanding of T1D pathogenesis, and our data lay the foundation for hypothesis generation and follow-on experiments."

Print 2019 Apr 1.,Keywords: elite controller; human immunodeficiency virus; machine learning; mass cytometry; natural killer cells.,"HIV infection is controlled immunologically in a small subset of infected individuals without antiretroviral therapy (ART), though the mechanism of control is unclear. CD8+ T cells are a critical component of HIV control in many immunological controllers. NK cells are also believed to have a role in controlling HIV infection, though their role is less well characterized. We used mass cytometry to simultaneously measure the levels of expression of 24 surface markers on peripheral NK cells from HIV-infected subjects with various degrees of HIV natural control; we then used machine learning to identify NK cell subpopulations that differentiate HIV controllers from noncontrollers. Using CITRUS (cluster identification, characterization, and regression), we identified 3 NK cell subpopulations that differentiated subjects with chronic HIV viremia (viremic noncontrollers [VNC]) from individuals with undetectable HIV viremia without ART (elite controllers [EC]). In a parallel approach, we identified 11 NK cell subpopulations that differentiated HIV-infected subject groups using k-means clustering after dimensionality reduction by t-neighbor stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) or linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Among these additional 11 subpopulations, the frequencies of 5 correlated with HIV DNA levels; importantly, significance was retained in 2 subpopulations in analyses that included only cohorts without detectable viremia. By comparing the surface marker expression patterns of all identified subpopulations, we revealed that the CD11b+ CD57- CD161+ Siglec-7+ subpopulation of CD56dim CD16+ NK cells are more abundant in EC and HIV-negative controls than in VNC and that the frequency of these cells correlated with HIV DNA levels. We hypothesize that this population may have a role in immunological control of HIV infection.IMPORTANCE HIV infection results in the establishment of a stable reservoir of latently infected cells; ART is usually required to keep viral replication under control and disease progression at bay, though a small subset of HIV-infected subjects can control HIV infection without ART through immunological mechanisms. In this study, we sought to identify subpopulations of NK cells that may be involved in the natural immunological control of HIV infection. We used mass cytometry to measure surface marker expression on peripheral NK cells. Using two distinct semisupervised machine learning approaches, we identified a CD11b+ CD57- CD161+ Siglec-7+ subpopulation of CD56dim CD16+ NK cells that differentiates HIV controllers from noncontrollers. These cells can be sorted out for future functional studies to assess their potential role in the immunological control of HIV infection."

Cluster analyses of data from high-throughput mass and flow cytometry marker panels permit discovery of previously undescribed immune cell phenotypes. Impactful reporting of new phenotypes demands low-dimensional visualization tools that preserve with integrity phenotypes' original high-dimensional structure. For this purpose, we introduce penalized supervised star plots. As designed and as we demonstrate, penalized supervised star plots are two-dimensional projections that tend to preserve separation of clusters as well as information on the relative contributions of various markers in differentiating phenotypes. The new method is robust to markers that do not differentiate phenotypes at all, as shown in a challenge data set. Results include comparison with other popular procedures. Penalized supervised star plots incorporate cross-validation to permit portability of estimated optimal projections to new samples. Supervised star plots are further illustrated with a featured influenza-specific T cell data set as well as a peripheral blood mononuclear cell phenotyping data set."

Here we identify AIRE expression in human tonsils and extensively analyzed these ""extra-thymic AIRE expressing cells"" (eTACs) using combinations of flow cytometry, CyTOF and single cell RNA-sequencing. We identified AIRE+ cells as dendritic cells (DCs) with a mature and migratory phenotype including high levels of antigen presenting molecules and costimulatory molecules, and specific expression of CD127, CCR7, and PDL1. These cells also possessed the ability to stimulate and re-stimulate T cells and displayed reduced responses to toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists compared to conventional DCs. While expression of AIRE was enriched within CCR7+CD127+ DCs, single-cell RNA sequencing revealed expression of AIRE to be transient, rather than stable, and associated with the differentiation to a mature phenotype. The role of AIRE in central tolerance induction within the thymus is well-established, however our study shows that AIRE expression within the periphery is not associated with an enriched expression of tissue-restricted antigens (TRAs). This unexpected finding, suggestive of wider functions of AIRE, may provide an explanation for the non-autoimmune symptoms of APECED patients who lack functional AIRE."

Epub 2019 Jan 27.,Keywords: CyTOF; QSC beads; biomarkers; mass cytometry; multiple sclerosis; natalizumab; optimization; quantitative analysis; receptor occupancy; standardization.,"Receptor occupancy, the ratio between amount of drug bound and amount of total receptor on single cells, is a biomarker for treatment response to therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Receptor occupancy is traditionally measured by flow cytometry. However, spectral overlap in flow cytometry limits the number of markers that can be measured simultaneously. This restricts receptor occupancy assays to the analysis of major cell types, although rare cell populations are of potential therapeutic relevance. We therefore developed a receptor occupancy assay suitable for mass cytometry. Measuring more markers than currently available in flow cytometry allows simultaneous receptor occupancy assessment and high-parameter immune phenotyping in whole blood, which should yield new insights into disease activity and therapeutic effects. However, varying sensitivity across the mass cytometer detection range may lead to misinterpretation of the receptor occupancy when drug and receptor are detected in different channels. In this report, we describe a method for optimization of mass cytometry receptor occupancy measurements by using antibody-binding quantum simply cellular (QSC) beads for standardization across channels with different sensitivities. We evaluated the method in a mass cytometry-based receptor occupancy assay for natalizumab, a therapeutic antibody used in multiple sclerosis treatment that binds to α4-integrin, which is expressed on leukocyte cell surfaces. Peripheral blood leukocytes from a treated patient were stained with a panel containing metal-conjugated antibodies for detection of natalizumab and α4-integrin. QSC beads with known antibody binding capacity were stained with the same metal-conjugated antibodies and were used to standardize the signal intensity in the leukocyte sample before calculating receptor occupancy. We found that QSC bead standardization across channels corrected for sensitivity differences for detection of drug and receptor and generated more accurate results than observed without standardization. © 2019 The Authors.

Instead of fighting disease, immune cells may increase pathology and suppress host-protective immune responses. Myeloid cells show high plasticity and adapt to changing conditions and pathological challenges. Despite their relevance in disease pathophysiology, the identity, heterogeneity and biology of myeloid cells is still poorly understood. We will focus on phenotypical and functional markers of one of the key myeloid regulatory subtypes, the myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), in humans, mice and non-human primates. Technical issues regarding the isolation of the cells from tissues and blood, timing and sample handling of MDSC will be detailed. Localization of MDSC in a tissue context is of crucial importance and immunohistochemistry approaches for this purpose are discussed. A minimal antibody panel for MDSC research is provided as part of the Mye-EUNITER COST action. Strategies for the identification of additional markers applying state of the art technologies such as mass cytometry will be highlighted. Such marker sets can be used to study MDSC phenotypes across tissues, diseases as well as species and will be crucial to accelerate MDSC research in health and disease."

Certain drugs, such as mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), are effective at reducing morbidity associated with nephritis; however, the immune pathways associated with disease suppression are poorly defined. Here, we provide evidence that MMF inhibits phosphorylation of STAT3 and other associated immune pathways. Using mass cytometry and bead-based or ELISA assays, the systemic phenotype of SLE patients not taking (MMF-) or taking (MMF+) MMF were studied. MMF+ SLE patients had significant reductions in total numbers of transitional B cells, plasmablasts, and T cells, specifically CD4+ Th17-type and CD4+ Treg-type cells, compared with MMF- patients. Plasma soluble mediators were decreased in MMF+ patients including chemokines (MIG/CXCL9 and SDF-1α/CXCL12) and growth factors (VEGF-A and PDGF-BB). Soluble mediators and cell subsets grouped by functional properties revealed significant modifications associated with STAT3 and B cell pathways. Further, healthy PBMCs treated with IL-6 revealed a reduction in p-STAT3 following the addition of mycophenolic acid (the active metabolite of MMF). In conclusion, the inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation by MMF may explain the effectiveness of this treatment in SLE patients, since increased levels of p-STAT3 are associated with disease pathology."

To test this hypothesis, global transcriptome analysis was performed on purified AMs from 20 individuals split evenly between HIV-uninfected nonsmokers and smokers and untreated HIV-infected nonsmokers and smokers. Differential expression analysis identified 143 genes significantly altered by the combination of HIV infection and smoking. Of the differentially expressed genes, chitinase 1 (CHIT1) and cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily B member 1 (CYP1B1), both previously associated with COPD, were among the most upregulated genes (5- and 26-fold, respectively) in the untreated HIV-infected smoker cohort compared with HIV-uninfected nonsmokers. Expression of CHIT1 and CYP1B1 correlated with the expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix organization, oxidative stress, immune response, and cell death. Using time-of-flight mass cytometry to characterize AMs, a significantly decreased expression of CD163, an M2 marker, was seen in HIV-infected subjects, and CD163 inversely correlated with CYP1B1 expression in AMs. CHIT1 protein levels were significantly upregulated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from HIV-infected smokers, and increased CHIT1 levels negatively correlated with lung function measurements. Overall, these findings raise the possibility that elevated CHIT1 and CYP1B1 are early indicators of COPD development in HIV-infected smokers that may serve as biomarkers for determining this risk."

Herein we review the most common approaches available to describe T cell activation, T cell molecular heterogeneity, and T cell function. We present informatic tools useful to both seasoned bioinformaticians and novices alike, providing a comprehensive overview of the in silico methods used to study T cell biology. With the goal of making this manuscript useful to a broad range of readers, we focus only on freely available tools and algorithms, and we describe the concepts using simple and direct language.

Epub 2018 Dec 28.,Article has no keywords,"Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is well known for its important function in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quiescence. However, the molecular mechanism underlining this function remains obscure. Endoglin (Eng), a type III receptor for the TGF-β superfamily, has been shown to selectively mark long-term HSCs; however, its necessity in adult HSCs is unknown due to embryonic lethality. Using conditional deletion of Eng combined with serial transplantation, we show that this TGF-β receptor is critical to maintain the HSC pool. Transplantation of Eng-deleted whole bone marrow or purified HSCs into lethally irradiated mice results in a profound engraftment defect in tertiary and quaternary recipients. Cell cycle analysis of primary grafts revealed decreased frequency of HSCs in G0, suggesting that lack of Eng impairs reentry of HSCs to quiescence. Using cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) to evaluate the activity of signaling pathways in individual HSCs, we find that Eng is required within the Lin-Sca+Kit+-CD48- CD150+ fraction for canonical and noncanonical TGF-β signaling, as indicated by decreased phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 and the p38 MAPK-activated protein kinase 2, respectively. These findings support an essential role for Eng in positively modulating TGF-β signaling to ensure maintenance of HSC quiescence."

This approach offers researchers the capability to interrogate rare subpopulations of cells with minimal sample consumption and multiplexed readouts. Recent technological advances in the optical interrogation and manipulation of single cells have substantially increased the throughput and sensitivity of these assays. Areas covered: In this review, the authors focus on three classes of single-cell imaging-based analyses: single-cell microscopy combined with microfluidics, mass spectrometric imaging for subcellular compound localization, and imaging mass cytometry (IMC). They provide an overview of each technology and recent examples of their utility in advancing drug discovery, based on the potential for scalability, multiplexing, and capability to generate definitive data on cellular heterogeneity and target engagement. Expert opinion: Understanding target engagement and heterogeneity at the single-cell level will enable the development of safer and more effective therapies, particularly for new modalities like CAR-T cell therapies and gene editing approaches (AAV, CRISPR). Successful adoption of new single-cell imaging-based approaches in drug discovery will require tandem investment in advanced computational analysis and bioinformatic approaches, due to the complexity and multivariate nature of single-cell imaging data."

We hypothesized that monocytes were likely more heterogeneous in composition. Approach and Results- We used the high dimensionality of mass cytometry together with the FlowSOM clustering algorithm to accurately identify and define monocyte subsets in blood of healthy human subjects and those with coronary artery disease (CAD). To study the behavior and functionality of the newly defined monocyte subsets, we performed RNA sequencing, transwell migration, and efferocytosis assays. Here, we identify 8 human monocyte subsets based on their surface marker phenotype. We found that 3 of these subsets fall within the CD16+ nonclassical monocyte population and 4 subsets belong to the CD14+ classical monocytes, illustrating significant monocyte heterogeneity in humans. As nonclassical monocytes are important in modulating atherosclerosis in mice, we studied the functions of our 3 newly identified nonclassical monocytes in subjects with CAD. We found a marked expansion of a Slan+CXCR6+ nonclassical monocyte subset in CAD subjects, which was positively correlated with CAD severity. This nonclassical subset can migrate towards CXCL16 and shows an increased efferocytosis capacity, indicating it may play an atheroprotective role. Conclusions- Our data demonstrate that human nonclassical monocytes are a heterogeneous population, existing of several subsets with functional differences. These subsets have changed frequencies in the setting of severe CAD. Understanding how these newly identified subsets modulate CAD will be important for CAD-based therapies that target myeloid cells."

Epub 2019 Jan 9.,Keywords: CyTOF; immune checkpoints; inflammation; single-cell proteomics; ulcerative colitis.,"Immune checkpoints are regulators of immune cells and play key roles in the modulation of immune responses. The role of checkpoints in autoimmune disease is poorly understood but likely to be central since checkpoint inhibition during cancer treatment can cause autoimmunity. We generated a high-dimensional single-cell proteomics data set from PBMCs of healthy individuals and patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) by mass cytometry, enabling systems-wide analyses of immune cell frequencies and cell type-specific expression patterns of 12 immune checkpoints. Subtle but significant changes in immune cell frequencies and checkpoint expression were observed between UC patients on different treatment regimens and between patients and healthy controls. Most strikingly, UC patients showed a reduced number of peripheral NK-cells and those cells showed an altered phenotype including increased TIGIT expression. Based on these results, we modulated NK-cell function ex vivo through targeting of TIGIT pathway members. In summary, we describe a pattern of changes in immune cell abundance and checkpoint expression as a basis for UC patient stratification and we show modulation of a corresponding immune cell subset through checkpoint targeting. Our approach can be used for the identification of pathogenic immune cell subsets and guide target selection in autoimmunity and chronic inflammation."

As such, tools simultaneously capable of highly multiplexed profiling of tissues' protein and RNA content, as well as interrogation of rare or single cells, are required to precisely characterize constituent tumor cell populations, infiltrating lymphocytes and stromal elements. Access to spatial relationships will enable more precise characterization of tumors, support patient stratification and may help to identify novel drug targets. Multiple platforms are being developed to address these critical unmet needs. The NanoString digital spatial profiling (DSP) platform enables highly multiplexed, spatial assessment of protein and/or RNA targets in tissues by detecting oligonucleotide barcodes conjugated via a photocleavable linker to primary antibodies or nucleic acid probes. Although this platform enables high-dimensional spatial interrogation of tissue protein and RNA expression, a detailed understanding of its composition, function and chemistry is advisable to guide experimental design and data interpretation. The purpose of this review is to provide an independent, comprehensive description of the DSP technology, including an overview of NanoString's capture and antibody barcode conjugation chemistries, experimental workflow, data output and analysis methods. The DSP technology will be discussed in the context of other highly multiplexed immunohistochemistry methods, including imaging mass cytometry and multiplexed ion beam imaging, to inform potential users of the advantages and limitations of each. Additional issues such as preanalytical variability, sampling and specimen adequacy will be considered with respect to the platforms to inform potential experimental design.

High copy numbers of VZV were detected in the blood, and the patients were successfully treated with acyclovir and intravenous immunoglobulins. After treatment with corticosteroids for the HLH, both patients made a full recovery. Although the mechanisms leading to this disease constellation have yet to be characterized, we hypothesize that impairment of the immunoregulatory role of NK cells in GATA2-haploinsufficiency may have accentuated the patients' susceptibility to HLH. Expansion of a double negative T-lymphocytic population identified with CyTOF could be a further factor contributing to HLH in these patients. This is the first report of VZV-triggered HLH-like disease in a primary immunodeficiency and the third report of HLH in GATA2-haploinsufficiency. Since HLH was part of the presentation in one of our patients, GATA2-haploinsufficiency represents a potential differential diagnosis in patients presenting with the clinical features of HLH-especially in cases of persisting cytopenia after recovery from HLH."

For example it can be combined with other computational and analytic approaches, and the results can be exported to FlowJo or Cytobank to be explored by researchers using those platforms. We demonstrate how CytoML and related R packages can be used as a tool to import, modify and export several samples stained with the T cell panel from the FlowCAP IV Lyoplate data set.

Here, we review the advantages of multiplex, single-cell mass cytometry in tissue and solid tumor investigations. Mass cytometry can quantitatively probe nearly any cellular feature or target. In discussing the ability of mass cytometry to reveal and characterize a broad spectrum of cell types, identify rare cells, and study functional behavior through protein signaling networks in millions of individual cells from a tumor, this review surveys publications of scientific advances in solid tumor biology made with the aid of mass cytometry. Advances discussed include functional identification of rare tumor and tumor-infiltrating immune cells and dissection of cellular mechanisms of immunotherapy in solid tumors and the periphery. The review concludes by highlighting ways to incorporate single-cell mass cytometry in solid tumor precision oncology efforts and rapidly developing cytometry techniques for quantifying cell location and sequenced nucleic acids."

Flow cytometry in relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) patients treated with daratumumab revealed cytotoxic T-cell expansion and reduction of immune-suppressive populations, suggesting immune modulation as an additional mechanism of action. Here, we performed an in-depth analysis of the effects of daratumumab on immune-cell subpopulations using high-dimensional mass cytometry. Whole-blood and bone-marrow baseline and on-treatment samples from RRMM patients who participated in daratumumab monotherapy studies (SIRIUS and GEN501) were evaluated with high-throughput immunophenotyping. In daratumumab-treated patients, the intensity of CD38 marker expression decreased on many immune cells in SIRIUS whole-blood samples. Natural killer (NK) cells were depleted with daratumumab, with remaining NK cells showing increased CD69 and CD127, decreased CD45RA, and trends for increased CD25, CD27, and CD137 and decreased granzyme B. Immune-suppressive population depletion paralleled previous findings, and a newly observed reduction in CD38+ basophils was seen in patients who received monotherapy. After 2 months of daratumumab, the T-cell population in whole-blood samples from responders shifted to a CD8 prevalence with higher granzyme B positivity (P = 0.017), suggesting increased killing capacity and supporting monotherapy-induced CD8+ T-cell activation. High-throughput cytometry immune profiling confirms and builds upon previous flow cytometry data, including comparable CD38 marker intensity on plasma cells, NK cells, monocytes, and B/T cells. Interestingly, a shift toward cytolytic granzyme B+ T cells was also observed and supports adaptive responses in patients that may contribute to depth of response. © 2018 The Authors.

There has been little development in these methodologies since that time, a period that has witnessed huge technological advances, particularly with the emergence of digital multi-parameter flow cytometric systems. Concurrent advancement in our understanding of redox regulation within eukaryotic cellular systems has also followed, whereby it is now accepted that cysteine thiols partake in redox reactions, which regulate protein activity and function (Groitl and Jakob (2014), Won et al. (2012)). Moreover, we are at the dawn of a new era in redox biology whereby the importance of 'reductive stress' in eukaryotic cellular systems is gathering momentum (Wadley et al. (2018) [4]). It is therefore critical that methods be continually advanced to better understand these concepts in more detail at the cellular level. Flow cytometry is a powerful technique that may be used for this purpose. Henceforth we have rejuvenated these methods to address modern scientific questions. In this paper, essential detail is provided on: •The adaption of a protocol initially described by Durand and Olive [1] for use with modern digital flow cytometer configurations. Here we provide optimal conditions for labelling intracellular thiols with F5M for detection using digital flow cytometers. Our modifications avoid the use of methanol fixation thus preserving cell viability in single cell suspension cultures.•Demonstration that flow cytometry can detect the gain and loss of reduced intracellular thiols in cells exposed to physiological doses of hydrogen peroxide mediated by glucose oxidase (Hole et al.

Recurring cytogenetic abnormalities and molecular lesions identify AML patient subgroups with different survival probabilities; however, 50⁻70% of AML cases harbor either normal or risk-indeterminate karyotypes. The discovery of better biomarkers of clinical success and failure is therefore necessary to inform tailored therapeutic decisions. Harnessing the immune system against cancer with programmed death-1 (PD-1)-directed immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and other immunotherapy agents is an effective therapeutic option for several advanced malignancies. However, durable responses have been observed in only a minority of patients, highlighting the need to gain insights into the molecular features that predict response and to also develop more effective and rational combination therapies that address mechanisms of immune evasion and resistance. We will review the state of knowledge of the immune landscape of AML and identify the broad opportunity to further explore this incompletely characterized space. Multiplexed, spatially-resolved immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry/mass cytometry, proteomic and transcriptomic approaches are advancing our understanding of the complexity of AML-immune interactions and are expected to support the design and expedite the delivery of personalized immunotherapy clinical trials."

So far, CyTOF has not been used in sepsis - a condition characterized by complex immune disorders. Here, we evaluated feasibility of CyTOF analysis in patients with septic shock. We designed a mass cytometry panel of 25 extracellular markers to study mononuclear cells from 5 septic shock patients and 5 healthy donors. We explored single-cell data with global and specific unsupervised approaches such as heatmaps, SPADE and viSNE. We first validated relevance of our CyTOF results by highlighting established immune hallmarks of sepsis, such as decreased monocyte HLA-DR expression and increased expressions of PD1 and PD-L1 on CD4 T cells and monocytes. We then showed that CyTOF analysis reveals novel aspects of sepsis-induced immune alterations, e.g. B cell shift towards plasma cell differentiation and uniform response of several monocyte markers defining an immune signature in septic patients. This proof of concept study demonstrates CyTOF suitability to analyse immune features of septic patients. Mass cytometry could thus represent a powerful tool to identify novel pathophysiological mechanisms and therapeutic targets for immunotherapy in septic shock patients."

Twelve patients with paired frozen PBMCs before and after 6-month abatacept treatment were included in this sub-study where mass cytometry (CyTOF) was chosen as a technology to be tested for its utility in a real-life clinical immune monitoring setting. Using CyTOF, the peripheral T cell phenotypes demonstrated considerable variation over time and between individuals precluding the identification of treatment-specific changes. We therefore conclude that studies of patient cohorts displaying wide clinical heterogeneity using mass cytometry must be relatively large in order to be suited for discovery research and immune monitoring. Still, we did find some correlations with functional muscle outcome, namely positive correlations between the ratio of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells (CD4/CD8) in peripheral blood samples both at baseline and after treatment with muscle endurance improvement as assessed by the functional index-2 (FI-2) test. Our data suggest that the CD4/CD8 ratio in circulation at time of active disease may be a predictor of treatment efficacy in myositis patients."

To delineate signaling abnormalities in JDM, mass cytometry was performed with PBMCs from treatment-naive JDM patients and controls. NK cell percentages were lower while frequencies of naive B cells and naive CD4+ T cells were higher in JDM patients than in controls. These cell frequency differences were attenuated with cessation of active disease. A large number of signaling differences were identified in treatment-naive JDM patients compared with controls. Classification models incorporating feature selection demonstrated that differences in phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2) phosphorylation comprised 10 of 12 features (i.e., phosphoprotein in a specific immune cell subset) distinguishing the 2 groups. Because NK cells represented 5 of these 12 features, further studies focused on the PLCγ2 pathway in NK cells, which is responsible for stimulating calcium flux and cytotoxic granule movement. No differences were detected in upstream signaling or total PLCγ2 protein levels. Hypophosphorylation of PLCγ2 and downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 were partially attenuated with cessation of active disease. PLCγ2 hypophosphorylation in treatment-naive JDM patients resulted in decreased calcium flux. The identification of dysregulation of PLCγ2 phosphorylation and decreased calcium flux in NK cells provides potential mechanistic insight into JDM pathogenesis."

In 23% of samples, we found sensitivity to inhibition of colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) receptor (CSF1R), a receptor tyrosine kinase responsible for survival, proliferation, and differentiation of myeloid-lineage cells. Sensitivity to CSF1R inhibitor GW-2580 was found preferentially in de novo and favorable-risk patients, and resistance to GW-2580 was associated with reduced overall survival. Using flow cytometry, we discovered that CSF1R is not expressed on the majority of leukemic blasts but instead on a subpopulation of supportive cells. Comparison of CSF1R-expressing cells in AML vs healthy donors by mass cytometry revealed expression of unique cell-surface markers. The quantity of CSF1R-expressing cells correlated with GW-2580 sensitivity. Exposure of primary AML patient samples to a panel of recombinant cytokines revealed that CSF1R inhibitor sensitivity correlated with a growth response to CSF1R ligand, CSF1, and other cytokines, including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). The addition of CSF1 increased the secretion of HGF and other cytokines in conditioned media from AML patient samples, whereas adding GW-2580 reduced their secretion. In untreated cells, HGF levels correlated significantly with GW-2580 sensitivity. Finally, recombinant HGF and HS-5-conditioned media rescued cell viability after GW-2580 treatment in AML patient samples. Our results suggest that CSF1R-expressing cells support the bulk leukemia population through the secretion of HGF and other cytokines. This study identifies CSF1R as a novel therapeutic target of AML and provides a mechanism of paracrine cytokine/growth factor signaling in this disease."

With current multidrug combinations and autologous transplant, rates of overall response exceed 90% and complete response (CR) more than 50% in some studies. Unfortunately, despite higher rates of CR, relapse rates remain high suggesting that persistent disease may not be measured by current techniques. Traditionally, response rates were defined by urine and serum protein electrophoresis, immunofixation and histopathological absence of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow. Currently, there are several validated sensitive assays to evaluate for MRD (minimal residual disease); multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) including nextgeneration flow cytometry (NGF), next-generation sequencing (NGS), and allele specific oligonucleotide quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ASO-qPCR). These methods have provided a means to quantitatively assess residual disease and accurately prognosticate PFS and OS in myeloma. In this chapter, we will discuss the current techniques for MRD detection as well as describe techniques that are emerging for improved characterization of drug resistant residual populations that could be adapted for MRD monitoring in the future. While improved therapies are able to eradicate the dominant clone, resistant sub-clones persist and remain undetectable even by MRD techniques. Characterization of these clones will help design therapies against drug-resistant clones and move us closer to a cure in MM."

Transcriptomic and mass cytometry analysis of repopulated microglia demonstrates an interferon regulatory factor 7-driven activation state. Minocycline and anti-IFNAR1 antibody treatment attenuate the CNS type 1 interferon-driven inflammation, restore microglia homeostasis and reduce ataxic behavior. Neither microglia depletion nor repopulation impact neuropathology or T-cell responses during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

Utilizing flow cytometry analysis in a cohort of 259 patients ranging from benign to malignant primary and metastatic brain tumors, we found that GBM patients had a significant elevation in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in peripheral blood but not immunosuppressive Tregs. In GBM patient tissue, we found that increased MDSC levels in recurrent GBM portended poor prognosis. CyTOF analysis of peripheral blood from newly diagnosed GBM patients revealed that reduced MDSCs over time were accompanied by a concomitant increase in DCs. GBM patients with extended survival also had reduced MDSCs, similar to the levels of low-grade glioma (LGG) patients. Our findings provide a rationale for developing strategies to target MDSCs, which are elevated in GBM patients and predict poor prognosis."

Both technologies have been utilized for analysis of the cell cycle state of ex vivo samples from patients with hematologic malignancies. Clinical samples are frequently stored for hours at room temperature or cryogenically frozen before processing and analysis; however, how these processing methods alter cell cycle state is not well described. To understand how storage time and temperature affect the analysis of cell cycle distribution by MCM, two leukemia cell lines, HL-60 and MOLM13, and primary human cells from three human bone marrow aspirates were stored and frozen under a variety of conditions that are likely to be encountered in a clinical setting. Our findings indicate that short delays in sample processing (less than 1 h), have little to no effect on cell cycle distribution, while longer delays or cryopreservation cause significant disruptions to the cell cycle fraction characterized by consistent reductions in IdU incorporation and variable alterations in other cell cycle phases. Analysis of the recovery of cryopreserved leukemia cell lines and marrow cells demonstrated that cell cycle alterations persist for at least 48 h after thawing. Our findings demonstrate that accurate cell cycle analysis requires that samples be processed rapidly after collection, and that cryopreservation significantly alters cell cycle fractions. Measurement of IdU incorporation was the most sensitive to both delays in processing and cryopreservation, while estimation of the total cycling cell fraction using Ki-67 or phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein were least altered by the conditions tested. These findings provide guidance for the ideal approach to collection of samples for cell cycle analysis and can aid interpretation of cell cycle data from samples that cannot be collected under ideal circumstances. © 2018 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry."

Common methods for the analysis of autophagy are bulk measurements which mask organelle heterogeneity and complicate the analysis of interorganelle association and trafficking. Thus, methods for individual organelle quantification are needed to address these deficiencies. Current techniques for quantifying individual autophagy organelles are either low through-put or are dimensionally limited. We make use of the multiparametric capability of mass cytometry to investigate phenotypic heterogeneity in autophagy-related organelle types that have been isolated from murine brain, liver, and skeletal muscle. Detection and phenotypic classification of individual organelles were accomplished through the use of a lanthanide-chelating membrane stain and organelle-specific antibodies. Posthoc sample matrix background correction and nonspecific antibody binding corrections provide measures of interorganelle associations and heterogeneity. This is the first demonstration of multiparametric individual organelle analysis via mass cytometry. The method described here illustrates the potential for further investigation of the inherently complex interorganelle associations, trafficking, and heterogeneity present in most eukaryotic biological systems."

However, current technology, which utilizes DNA as barcodes, permits limited phenotyping and bulk-cell resolution. To enable novel screening capabilities, we developed a barcoding system operating at the protein level. We synthesized modules encoding triplet combinations of linear epitopes to generate >100 unique protein barcodes (Pro-Codes). Pro-Code-expressing vectors were introduced into cells and analyzed by CyTOF mass cytometry. Using just 14 antibodies, we detected 364 Pro-Code populations; establishing the largest set of protein-based reporters. By pairing each Pro-Code with a different CRISPR, we simultaneously analyzed multiple phenotypic markers, including phospho-signaling, on dozens of knockouts. Pro-Code/CRISPR screens found two interferon-stimulated genes, the immunoproteasome component Psmb8 and a chaperone Rtp4, are important for antigen-dependent immune editing of cancer cells and identified Socs1 as a negative regulator of Pd-l1. The Pro-Code technology enables simultaneous high-dimensional protein-level phenotyping of 100s of genes with single-cell resolution."

Applying MASC to mass cytometry analyses of CD4+ T cells from the blood of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and controls revealed a significantly expanded population of CD4+ T cells, identified as CD27- HLA-DR+ effector memory cells, in RA patients (odds ratio, 1.7; P = 1.1 × 10-3). The frequency of CD27- HLA-DR+ cells was similarly elevated in blood samples from a second RA patient cohort, and CD27- HLA-DR+ cell frequency decreased in RA patients who responded to immunosuppressive therapy. Mass cytometry and flow cytometry analyses indicated that CD27- HLA-DR+ cells were associated with RA (meta-analysis P = 2.3 × 10-4). Compared to peripheral blood, synovial fluid and synovial tissue samples from RA patients contained about fivefold higher frequencies of CD27- HLA-DR+ cells, which comprised ~10% of synovial CD4+ T cells. CD27- HLA-DR+ cells expressed a distinctive effector memory transcriptomic program with T helper 1 (TH1)- and cytotoxicity-associated features and produced abundant interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and granzyme A protein upon stimulation.

Transcription profiling has identified molecular subtypes for ILC, one of which, immune-related (IR), is associated with gene expression linked to lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration. Here, we report that deletion of Cdh1, together with activation of Pik3ca in mammary epithelium of genetically modified mice, leads to formation of IR-ILC-like tumors with immune cell infiltration, as well as gene expression linked to T-regulatory (Treg) cell signaling and activation of targetable immune checkpoint pathways. Interestingly, these tumors show enhanced Rac1- and Yap-dependent transcription and signaling, as well as sensitivity to PI3K, Rac1, and Yap inhibitors in culture. Finally, high-dimensional immunophenotyping in control mouse mammary gland and IR-ILC tumors by mass cytometry shows dramatic alterations in myeloid and lymphoid populations associated with immune suppression and exhaustion, highlighting the potential for therapeutic intervention via immune checkpoint regulators."

For the identification of such an elusive and rare subpopulation of cells, a single cell analysis technology with deep profiling capabilities known as Mass Cytometry (CyTOF) can prove to be highly useful. CyTOF circumvents the spectral overlap limitations of traditional flow cytometry by replacing fluorophores with metal isotope tags, allowing the accurate detection of significantly more parameters at the same time. In this chapter, we demonstrate that synthetic antibodies can be conjugated with metal isotope tags for CyTOF analysis, resulting in the development of a highly tailored, custom multi-parameter panel. This toolset was used to stain patient-derived GBM cells, which was analyzed via CyTOF. Analysis software viSNE and SPADE were applied to study the co-expression patterns of the Eph Receptor (EphR) family and several putative BTIC markers in GBM, resulting in the identification of a distinct group of cells consistent with a BTIC subpopulation. This approach can be readily adapted to the detection of cancer stem-like cells in other cancer types."

We identified a niche population located in proximity to epithelial crypts expressing SOX6, F3 (CD142), and WNT genes essential for colonic epithelial stem cell function. In colitis, we observed dysregulation of this niche and emergence of an activated mesenchymal population. This subset expressed TNF superfamily member 14 (TNFSF14), fibroblastic reticular cell-associated genes, IL-33, and Lysyl oxidases. Further, it induced factors that impaired epithelial proliferation and maturation and contributed to oxidative stress and disease severity in vivo.

An entire immune system with all of its cell populations must regenerate from infused donor hematopoietic stem cells over the course of weeks and months post-transplantation. Both innate and adaptive arms of the immune system differ in their capacity and speed to reconstitiute in the recipient, which contributes to inadequacy in global immunity during the delayed reconstitution period. Systems-level analyses of immune systems in human patients have been made possible by high-throughput and high-dimensional, state-of-the-art, single-cell methodologies such as mass cytometry. Mass cytometry has revolutionized our ability to comprehensively profile all immune cell populations simultaneously in blood or tissue samples, providing signatures of differentially regulated cells in a range of clinical conditions. Such kind of systems immunology analyses promise not only for more accurate descriptions of variation between patients but also within individual patients over time, inter-dependencies between cell populations and the inference of developmental trajectories for specific cell populations. Here, we took advantage of a recently performed longitudinal mass cytometry analysis in 26 patients with hematological malignancies followed during the first 12 months following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. We present a proof-of-principle analysis to understand the evolution of individual immune cell populations. By applying non-linear dimensionality reduction and feauture extraction algorithms, we infer trajectories for individual immune cell populations, and map continuous marker expression changes occuring during immune cell regeneration that add novel information about this developmental process."

The immunoassay multiplexing capacity relies on monoclonal antibodies labeled with stable heavy-metal isotopes. To date, a variety of rare-earth elements and noble and post-transition metal isotopes have been used in mass cytometry; nevertheless, the methods used for antibody conjugation differ because of the individual metal coordination chemistries and distinct stabilities of various metal cations. Herein, we provide three optimized protocols for conjugating monoclonal IgG antibodies with 48 high-purity heavy-metal isotopes: (i) 38 isotopes of lanthanides, 2 isotopes of indium, and 1 isotope of yttrium; (ii) 6 isotopes of palladium; and (iii) 1 isotope of bismuth. Bifunctional chelating agents containing coordinative ligands of monomeric DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) or polymeric pentetic acid (DTPA) were used to stably sequester isotopic cations in aqueous solutions and were subsequently coupled to IgG antibodies using site-specific biorthogonal reactions. Furthermore, quantification methods based on antibody inherent absorption at 280 nm and on extrinsic absorption at 562 nm after staining with bicinchoninic acid (BCA) are reported to determine metal-isotope-tagged antibodies. In addition, a freeze-drying procedure to prepare palladium isotopic mass tags is described. To demonstrate the utility, experiments using six palladium-tagged CD45 antibodies for barcoding assays of live immune cells in cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) are described.

Epub 2018 Sep 26.,Article has no keywords,"FGFR1 has been implicated in numerous cancer types including squamous cell lung cancer, a subset of non-small cell lung cancer with a dismal 5-year survival rate. Small-molecule inhibitors targeting FGFR1 are currently in clinical trials, with AZD4547 being one of the furthest along; however, the development of drug resistance is a major challenge for targeted therapies. A prevalent mechanism of drug resistance in kinases occurs through mutation of the gatekeeper residue, V561M in FGFR1; however, mechanisms underlying V561M resistance to AZD4547 are not fully understood. Here, the cellular consequences of the V561M gatekeeper mutation were characterized, and it was found that although AZD4547 maintains nanomolar affinity for V561M FGFR1, based on in vitro binding assays, cells expressing V561M demonstrate dramatic resistance to AZD4547 driven by increased STAT3 activation downstream of V561M FGFR1. The data reveal that the V561M mutation biases cells toward a more mesenchymal phenotype, including increased levels of proliferation, migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth, which was confirmed using CyTOF, a novel single-cell analysis tool. Using shRNA knockdown, loss of STAT3 restored sensitivity of cancer cells expressing V561M FGFR1 to AZD4547. Thus, the data demonstrate that combination therapies including FGFR and STAT3 may overcome V561M FGFR1-driven drug resistance in the clinic. IMPLICATIONS: The V561M FGFR1 gatekeeper mutation leads to devastating drug resistance through activation of STAT3 and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition; this study demonstrates that FGFR1 inhibitor sensitivity can be restored upon STAT3 knockdown."

Epub 2018 Sep 26.,Keywords: CD4 T memory stem cells; HIV; IL-15; SAMHD1.,"HIV integrates into the host genome to create a persistent viral reservoir. Stimulation of CD4+ memory T lymphocytes with common γc-chain cytokines renders these cells more susceptible to HIV infection, making them a key component of the reservoir itself. IL-15 is up-regulated during primary HIV infection, a time when the HIV reservoir established. Therefore, we investigated the molecular and cellular impact of IL-15 on CD4+ T-cell infection. We found that IL-15 stimulation induces SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) phosphorylation due to cell cycle entry, relieving an early block to infection. Perturbation of the pathways downstream of IL-15 receptor (IL-15R) indicated that SAMHD1 phosphorylation after IL-15 stimulation is JAK dependent. Treating CD4+ T cells with Ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2, effectively blocked IL-15-induced SAMHD1 phosphorylation and protected CD4+ T cells from HIV infection. Using high-resolution single-cell immune profiling using mass cytometry by TOF (CyTOF), we found that IL-15 stimulation altered the composition of CD4+ T-cell memory populations by increasing proliferation of memory CD4+ T cells, including CD4+ T memory stem cells (TSCM). IL-15-stimulated CD4+ TSCM, harboring phosphorylated SAMHD1, were preferentially infected. We propose that IL-15 plays a pivotal role in creating a self-renewing, persistent HIV reservoir by facilitating infection of CD4+ T cells with stem cell-like properties. Time-limited interventions with JAK1 inhibitors, such as Ruxolitinib, should prevent the inactivation of the endogenous restriction factor SAMHD1 and protect this long-lived CD4+ T-memory cell population from HIV infection."

By imaging mass cytometry, we find that MZ B cells and memory B cells occupy different microanatomical niches in organised gut lymphoid tissues. Both populations disseminate widely between distant lymphoid tissues and blood, and both diversify their IGHV repertoire in gut germinal centres (GC), but nevertheless remain largely clonally separate.

Epub 2018 Aug 20.,Keywords: cancer immunotherapy; clinical oncology; flow cytometry; mass cytometry.,"The introduction in the clinical practice of several new approaches to cancer immunotherapy has greatly increased the interest in analytical methodologies that can define the immunological profile of patients in the clinical setting. This requires huge effort to obtain reliable monitoring tools that could be used to improve the patient's clinical outcome. The clinical applications of flow cytometry (FCM) in oncology started with the measurement of DNA content for the evaluation of both ploidy and cell cycle profile as potential prognostic parameters in the majority of human solid cancer types. The availability of monoclonal antibodies widely broadened the spectrum of clinical applications of this technique, which rapidly became a fundamental tool for the diagnosis and prognosis of malignant hematological diseases. Among the emerging clinical applications of FCM, the study of minimal residual disease in hematological malignancies, the quantification of blood dendritic cells in various types of tumors, the study of metastatic spread in solid tumors throughout both the analysis of circulating endothelial progenitor cells and the identification and characterization of circulating tumor cells, all appear very promising. More recently, an advanced single cell analysis technique has been developed that combines the precision of mass spectrometry with the unique advantages of FCM. This approach, termed mass cytometry, utilizes antibodies conjugated to heavy metal ions for the analysis of cellular proteins by a mass spectrometer. It provides measurement of over 100 simultaneous cellular parameters in a single sample and has evolved from a promising technology to a high recognized platform for multi-dimensional single-cell analysis. Should a careful standardization of the analytical procedures be reached, both FCM and mass cytometry could effectively become ideal tools for the optimization of new immunotherapeutic approaches in cancer patients."

Many studies examine the cell surface expression of PD-1 and other key regulators of T-cell activation and inhibition. Here, we compared common commercially available anti-PD-1 diagnostic antibodies and tested whether they can bind the PD-1 receptor in the presence of the therapeutic antagonists pembrolizumab and nivolumab. We observed that currently no antibodies are available that can reliably stain all PD-1 receptors on T-cells from patients treated with anti-PD-1 antibodies. Furthermore, none of the diagnostic antibodies detected the entire population of PD-1+ T-cells relative to indirect staining using the therapeutic antibodies themselves.

Nevertheless, these are only beneficial for a small proportion of cancer patients. Important prognosticators for response to immunotherapy are the mutation burden of tumours as well as the quality and quantity of tumour-infiltrating immune cells. High-throughput multiplex immunophenotyping technologies have a central role in deciphering the complexity of anti-tumour immune responses. Current techniques for the immunophenotyping of solid tumours are held back by the lack of spatial context, limitations in the number of targets that can be visualised simultaneously, and/or cumbersome protocols. We developed a tyramide signal amplification-free method for the simultaneous detection of seven cellular targets by immunofluorescence. This method overcomes limitations posed by most widespread techniques and provides a unique tool for extensive phenotyping by multispectral fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, it can be easily implemented as a high-throughput technology for validation of discovery sets generated by RNA sequencing or mass cytometry and may serve in the future as a complementary diagnostic tool."

MSI has demonstrated its potential in numerous applications from drug discovery, disease state evaluation through proteomic and/or metabolomic studies. Significant technological and methodological advancements have addressed natural limitations of the techniques, i.e., increased spatial resolution, increased detection sensitivity especially for large molecules, higher throughput analysis and data management. One of the next major evolutions of MSI is linked to the introduction of imaging mass cytometry (IMC). IMC is a multiplexed method for tissue phenotyping, imaging signalling pathway or cell marker assessment, at sub-cellular resolution (1 μm). It uses MSI to simultaneously detect and quantify up to 30 different antibodies within a tissue section. The combination of MSI with other molecular imaging techniques can also provide highly relevant complementary information to explore new scientific fields. Traditionally, classical histology (especially haematoxylin and eosin-stained sections) is overlaid with molecular profiles obtained by MSI. Thus, MSI-based molecular histology provides a snapshot of a tissue microenvironment and enables the correlation of drugs, metabolites, lipids, peptides or proteins with histological/pathological features or tissue substructures. Recently, many examples combining MSI with other imaging modalities such as fluorescence, confocal Raman spectroscopy and MRI have emerged. For instance, brain pathophysiology has been studied using both MRI and MSI, establishing correlations between in and ex vivo molecular imaging techniques. Endogenous metabolite and small peptide modulation were evaluated depending on disease state. Here, we review advanced 'hot topics' in MSI development and explore the combination of MSI with established molecular imaging techniques to improve our understanding of biological and pathophysiological processes."

Neutrophils and monocytes originate from the granulocyte monocyte progenitor (GMP) in bone marrow; however, unipotent neutrophil progenitors are not well defined. Here, we use cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methodologies to identify a committed unipotent early-stage neutrophil progenitor (NeP) in adult mouse bone marrow. Importantly, we found a similar unipotent NeP (hNeP) in human bone marrow. Both NeP and hNeP generate only neutrophils. NeP and hNeP both significantly increase tumor growth when transferred into murine cancer models, including a humanized mouse model. hNeP are present in the blood of treatment-naive melanoma patients but not of healthy subjects. hNeP can be readily identified by flow cytometry and could be used as a biomarker for early cancer discovery. Understanding the biology of hNeP should allow the development of new therapeutic targets for neutrophil-related diseases, including cancer."

Here, we performed longitudinal analyses in 100 newborn children, sampled up to 4 times during their first 3 months of life. From 100 μL of blood, we analyze the development of 58 immune cell populations by mass cytometry and 267 plasma proteins by immunoassays, uncovering drastic changes not predictable from cord blood measurements but following a stereotypic pattern.

By using 3 metal isotopes and 4 ratio intensity levels, 16 barcodes were generated to code, and later decode, cell samples in mass cytometry. The ratiometric Ln-Pdot barcodes not only provided high-mass-signal intensities but also eliminated the bias caused by different concentrations of the labeling reagents/barcodes and run-to-run differences in cell labeling efficiency. The ability to distinguish clearly the 16 sets of labeled MCF-7 cells with mass cytometry demonstrated the excellent resolving power of the ratiometric Ln-Pdot barcodes. Furthermore, the results from barcoding PBMC samples via CD45-specific cellular targeting indicated that the ratiometric Ln-Pdot barcodes could facilitate mass cytometry in high-throughput and multiplexed analysis, especially with precious human samples."

Epub 2018 Aug 20.,Keywords: Cytokines; HIV infection; Mass cytometry; TLR stimulations.,"HIV infection is associated with chronic inflammation in both non-treated and treated patients. TLR-dependent mechanisms are strongly involved in the maintenance of this inflammation. Indeed, the residual replication of HIV, the potential viral co-infections, or the products issued from microbial translocation provide TLR ligands, which contribute to trigger innate immune responses. Maintaining this chronic inflammation leads to an exhaustion of the immune system. Therefore, the TLR-dependent responses could be altered in HIV-infected patients. To investigate this hypothesis, we performed high-resolution phenotyping using a mass cytometry panel of 34 cell markers. Whole blood cells from healthy, non-treated HIV-infected and ART-treated HIV-infected subjects were stimulated with LPS, R848 or Poly(I:C). We observed the immune responses induced in T-cells, B-cells, polymorphonuclear cells, NK cells, basophils, monocytes and dendritic cells. We observed that, for either LPS or R848 stimulations, the production of cytokines in monocytes and conventional dendritic cells was delayed in treated or non-treated HIV-infected patients, compared to healthy individuals. These results suggest that leukocytes from chronic HIV-infected patients are slower to respond following the sensing of pathogens and danger signals, which may be an important feature of HIV infection."

Epub 2018 Aug 22.,Article has no keywords,"Most infections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) manifest as a clinically asymptomatic, contained state, known as latent tuberculosis infection, that affects approximately one-quarter of the global population1. Although fewer than one in ten individuals eventually progress to active disease2, tuberculosis is a leading cause of death from infectious disease worldwide3. Despite intense efforts, immune factors that influence the infection outcomes remain poorly defined. Here we used integrated analyses of multiple cohorts to identify stage-specific host responses to Mtb infection. First, using high-dimensional mass cytometry analyses and functional assays of a cohort of South African adolescents, we show that latent tuberculosis is associated with enhanced cytotoxic responses, which are mostly mediated by CD16 (also known as FcγRIIIa) and natural killer cells, and continuous inflammation coupled with immune deviations in both T and B cell compartments. Next, using cell-type deconvolution of transcriptomic data from several cohorts of different ages, genetic backgrounds, geographical locations and infection stages, we show that although deviations in peripheral B and T cell compartments generally start at latency, they are heterogeneous across cohorts. However, an increase in the abundance of circulating natural killer cells in tuberculosis latency, with a corresponding decrease during active disease and a return to baseline levels upon clinical cure are features that are common to all cohorts. Furthermore, by analysing three longitudinal cohorts, we find that changes in peripheral levels of natural killer cells can inform disease progression and treatment responses, and inversely correlate with the inflammatory state of the lungs of patients with active tuberculosis. Together, our findings offer crucial insights into the underlying pathophysiology of tuberculosis latency, and identify factors that may influence infection outcomes."

We identified differential distribution of background values between samples, generated by either background calculation or spreading error (SE), as a major source of variability in polychromatic flow cytometry data representation by tSNE, ultimately resulting in the identification of erroneous heterogeneity among cell populations. Biexponential transformation of raw data and limiting SE during panel development dramatically improved data visualization. These aspects must be taken into consideration when using computational approaches as discovery tools in large sets of samples from independent experiments or immunomonitoring in clinical trials."

It enables the simultaneous measurement of over 40 markers on individual cells through the use of monoclonal antibodies conjugated to rare-earth heavy-metal isotopes. In contrast to the fluorochromes used in conventional flow cytometry, metal isotopes display minimal signal overlap when resolved by single-cell mass spectrometry. This review focuses on the potential of mass cytometry as a novel technology for studying immune reconstitution in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Reconstitution of a healthy donor-derived immune system after HSCT involves the coordinated regeneration of innate and adaptive immune cell subsets in the recipient. Mass cytometry presents an opportunity to investigate immune reconstitution post-HSCT from a systems-level perspective, by allowing the phenotypic and functional features of multiple cell populations to be assessed simultaneously. This review explores the current knowledge of immune reconstitution in HSCT recipients and highlights recent mass cytometry studies contributing to the field."

Even with current biologic therapies, the disease remains difficult to control in a substantial subset of patients, highlighting the need for new therapies. The aim of this study was to use the high dimensionality afforded by mass cytometry with phospho-specific antibodies to delineate signaling abnormalities in immune cells from treatment-naive polyarticular JIA patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 17 treatment-naive polyarticular JIA patients, 10 of the patients after achieving clinical remission, and 19 healthy controls. Samples were stimulated for 15 minutes with IL-6 or IFN-γ and analyzed by mass cytometry. Following IFN-γ stimulation, increased STAT1 and/or STAT3 phosphorylation was observed in subsets of CD4 T cells and classical monocytes from treatment-naive patients. The enhanced IFN-γ signaling was associated with increased expression of JAK1 and SOCS1 in CD4 T cells. Furthermore, substantial heterogeneity in surface marker expression was observed among the subsets of CD4 T cells and classical monocytes with increased IFN-γ responsiveness. The identification of enhanced IFN-γ signaling in CD4 T cells and classical monocytes from treatment-naive polyarticular JIA patients provides mechanistic support for investigations into therapies that attenuate IFN-γ signaling in this disease."

Different cytometry studies often involve diverse sets of markers. Moreover, the detected values of the same marker are inconsistent between studies due to different experimental designs and cytometer configurations. As a result, the cell subsets identified by existing auto-gating methods cannot be directly compared across studies. We developed MetaCyto for automated meta-analysis of both flow and mass cytometry (CyTOF) data. By combining clustering methods with a silhouette scanning method, MetaCyto is able to identify commonly labeled cell subsets across studies, thus enabling meta-analysis. Applying MetaCyto across a set of ten heterogeneous cytometry studies totaling 2,926 samples enabled us to identify multiple cell populations exhibiting differences in abundance between demographic groups.

Epub 2018 Jul 31.,Article has no keywords,"Purpose: Regulatory T (Treg) cells expressing the transcription factor FOXP3 are essential for the maintenance of immunologic self-tolerance but play a detrimental role in most cancers due to their ability to suppress antitumor immunity. The phenotype of human circulating Treg cells has been extensively studied, but less is known about tumor-infiltrating Treg cells. We studied the phenotype and function of tumor-infiltrating Treg cells in ovarian cancer and melanoma to identify potential Treg cell-associated molecules that can be targeted by tumor immunotherapies.Experimental Design: The phenotype of intratumoral and circulating Treg cells was analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry, mass cytometry, RNA-seq, and functional assays.Results: Treg cells isolated from ovarian tumors displayed a distinct cell surface phenotype with increased expression of a number of receptors associated with TCR engagement, including PD-1, 4-1BB, and ICOS. Higher PD-1 and 4-1BB expression was associated with increased responsiveness to further TCR stimulation and increased suppressive capacity, respectively. Transcriptomic and mass cytometry analyses revealed the presence of Treg cell subpopulations and further supported a highly activated state specifically in ovarian tumors. In comparison, Treg cells infiltrating melanomas displayed lower FOXP3, PD-1, 4-1BB, and ICOS expression and were less potent suppressors of CD8 T-cell proliferation.Conclusions: The highly activated phenotype of ovarian tumor-infiltrating Treg cells may be a key component of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Receptors that are expressed by tumor-infiltrating Treg cells could be exploited for the design of novel combination tumor immunotherapies. Clin Cancer Res; 24(22); 5685-96. ©2018 AACR."

The biomarkers are detected using metal-labeled antibodies as well as small-molecule probes of cell size, viability, and biochemical status. Barcoding is an important component of sample preparation because it reduces processing time, eliminates sample-to-sample variation, discriminates cell doublets, reduces the amount of antibody needed, and conserves sample. We developed a thiol-reactive tellurium-based barcode, TeMal. TeMal is nontoxic at working concentrations, compatible with metal-labeled antibodies, and can readily be applied to live or fixed cells, making it advantageous and complementary compared to existing barcoding reagents. We have demonstrated the utility of TeMal by barcoding microscale samples in situ to facilitate analysis of cells from an automated cell culture system using mass cytometry."

Here, we established that the response to combined RT and PD-L1 inhibition is transient and investigated mechanisms of resistance.Experimental Design: Mechanisms of resistance to RT and PD-L1 blockade were investigated in orthotopic murine head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors using mass cytometry and whole-genome sequencing. Mice were treated with anti-PD-L1 or anti-TIM-3 alone and in combination with and without RT. Tumor growth and survival were assessed. Flow cytometry was used to assess phenotypic and functional changes in intratumoral T-cell populations. Depletion of regulatory T cells (Treg) was performed using anti-CD25 antibody.Results: We show that the immune checkpoint receptor, TIM-3, is upregulated on CD8 T cells and Tregs in tumors treated with RT and PD-L1 blockade. Treatment with anti-TIM-3 concurrently with anti-PD-L1 and RT led to significant tumor growth delay, enhanced T-cell cytotoxicity, decreased Tregs, and improved survival in orthotopic models of HNSCC. Despite this treatment combination, the response was not durable, and analysis of relapsed tumors revealed resurgence of Tregs. Targeted Treg depletion, however, restored antitumor immunity in mice treated with RT and dual immune checkpoint blockade and resulted in tumor rejection and induction of immunologic memory.Conclusions: These data reveal multiple layers of immune regulation that can promote tumorigenesis and the therapeutic potential of sequential targeting to overcome tumor resistance mechanisms. We propose that targeted Treg inhibitors may be critical for achieving durable tumor response with combined radiotherapy and immunotherapy. Clin Cancer Res; 24(21); 5368-80. ©2018 AACR."

These immune cells play an important role in regulating tumour growth - progression or elimination. Some populations of cells have a strong correlation with disease-free survival, making them useful prognostic markers. In particular, the infiltrate of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells into CRC tumours has been validated worldwide as a valuable indicator of patient prognosis. However, the heterogeneity of the immune response, both between patients with tumours of different molecular subtypes, and within the tumour itself, necessitates the use of multiparametric analysis in the investigation of tumour-specific immune responses. This review will outline the multiparametric analysis techniques that have been developed and applied to studying the role of immune cells in the tumour, with a focus on colorectal cancer. Because much of the data in this disease relates to T cell subsets and heterogeneity, we have used T cell populations as examples throughout. Flow and mass cytometry give a detailed representation of the cells within the tumour in a single-cell suspension on a per-cell basis. Imaging technologies, such as imaging mass cytometry, are used to investigate increasing numbers of markers whilst retaining the spatial and structural information of the tumour section and the infiltrating immune cells. Together, the analyses of multiple immune parameters can provide valuable information to guide clinical decision-making in CRC."

To that end, we developed a novel antibody-based platform that allows the robust barcoding of live human cells for mass cytometry (CyTOF). By targeting both the MHC class I complex (beta-2-microglobulin) and a broadly expressed sodium-potassium ATPase-subunit (CD298) with platinum-conjugated antibodies, human immune cells, stem cells as well as tumor cells could be multiplexed in the same single-cell assay. In addition, we present a novel palladium-based covalent viability reagent compatible with this barcoding strategy. Altogether, this platform enables mass cytometry-based, live-cell barcoding across a multitude of human sample types and provides a scheme for multiplexed barcoding of human single-cell assays in general."

We demonstrate the validity of CyTOF for RBC phenotyping by confirming the progressive reduction of transferrin receptor 1 (CD71) during reticulocyte maturation to mature RBC. We highlight the high-dimensional nature of mass cytometry data by correlating the expression of multiple proteins on individual RBCs. We further describe a more drastic reduction pattern for a component of the alpha4/beta1 integrin CD49d at the very early steps of reticulocyte maturation in bone marrow and directly linked with the mitochondria remnants clearance pattern.

Using a highly specific EphR antibody panel and CyTOF (cytometry by time-of-flight), we characterized the expression of all 14 EphR in primary and recurrent patient-derived GSCs to identify putative rGBM-specific EphR. EPHA2 and EPHA3 coexpression marked a highly tumorigenic cell population in rGBM that was enriched in GSC marker expression.

Our results identify immune-dominant, serovar-specific, and cross-reactive T cell antigens, which should aid in the design of T cell-vaccination strategies against Salmonella."

However, CD32a was recently found to be expressed on CD4+ T cells of healthy donors, leading to controversy on the relevance of this marker in HIV persistence. Here, we used mass cytometry to characterize the landscape and variation in the abundance of CD32a+ CD4+ T cells during HIV infection. To this end, we analyzed CD32a+ CD4+ T cells in primary HIV infection before and after effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and in healthy donors. We found that CD32a+ CD4+ T cells include heterogeneous subsets that are differentially affected by HIV infection. Our analysis revealed that naive (N), central memory (CM), and effector/memory (Eff/Mem) CD32a+ CD4+ T-cell clusters that co-express LILRA2- and CD64-activating receptors were more abundant in primary HIV infection and cART stages. Conversely, LILRA2- CD32a+ CD4+ T-cell clusters of either the TN, TCM, or TEff/Mem phenotype were more abundant in healthy individuals. Finally, an activated CD32a+ CD4+ TEff/Mem cell cluster co-expressing LILRA2, CD57, and NKG2C was more abundant in all HIV stages, particularly during primary HIV infection. Overall, our data show that multiple abundance modifications of CD32a+ CD4+ T-cell subsets occur in the early phase of HIV infection, and some of which are conserved after effective cART. Our study brings a better comprehension of the relationship between CD32a expression and CD4+ T cells during HIV infection."

However, the mechanism driving IL-17 production is unclear. Here, we show a role for IL-2 triggering IL-17 production by lung granular γδ T cells as IL-17 synthesis and neutrophil recruitment was reduced by IL-2 blocking mAbs in vitro and in vivo. Mass cytometry analysis revealed that lung γδ T cells responded directly to IL-2 as evident from STAT5 phosphorylation and RoRγt expression. IL-2 receptor blocking mAbs and JAK inhibition impaired STAT5 phosphorylation and IL-17 release. Moreover, inhalation of S. aureus enterotoxin A induced IL-2 secretion and caspase-1-dependent IL-1β activation to drive IL-17 production. This T-cell-mediated inflammasome-dependent IL-17 response is maximum when lung Tγδ17 cells were sequentially stimulated first with IL-2 then IL-1β. Interestingly, when IL-2 is given therapeutically to cancer patients it carries a known risk of lung injury that is largely indistinguishable from that seen in sepsis. Hence, this novel mechanism reveals therapeutic targets treating both acute lung injury and high-dose IL-2 toxicity in cancer."

Unbiased molecular dissection of tumor parenchyma versus stroma in human-murine xenografts is critical for elucidating dysregulated protein networks/pathways and developing therapeutics that may target these two functionally codependent compartments. Although antibody-reliant technologies (e.g., immunohistochemistry, imaging mass cytometry) are capable of distinguishing tumor-proper versus stromal proteins, the breadth or extent of targets is limited. Here, we report an antibody-free targeted cross-species glycoproteomic (TCSG) approach that enables direct dissection of human tumor parenchyma from murine tumor stroma at the molecular/protein level in tumor xenografts at a selectivity rate presently unattainable by other means. This approach was used to segment/dissect and obtain the protein complement phenotype of the tumor stroma and parenchyma of the metastatic human lung adenocarcinoma A549 xenograft, with no need for tissue microdissection prior to mass-spectrometry analysis. An extensive molecular map of the tumor proper and the associated microenvironment was generated along with the top functional N-glycosylated protein networks enriched in each compartment. Importantly, immunohistochemistry-based cross-validation of selected parenchymal and stromal targets applied on human tissue samples of lung adenocarcinoma and normal adjacent tissue is indicative of a noteworthy translational capacity for this unique approach that may facilitate identifications of novel targets for next generation antibody therapies and development of real time preclinical tumor models."

Prior to 2011, melanoma patients only had palliative treatment solutions which offered little to no survival benefit. In 2018, with immunotherapy, melanoma patients can now contemplate durable or even complete remission. Treatment with novel immune checkpoint inhibitors, anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte protein 4 and anti-programmed cell death protein 1, clearly result in superior median and long-term survivals compared to standard chemotherapy; however, more than half of the patients do not respond to immune checkpoint blockade. Currently, clinicians do not have any effective way to stratify melanoma patients for immunotherapies. Research is now focusing on identifying biomarkers which could predict a patient's response prior treatment initiation (or very early during treatment course), in order to maximize therapeutic efficacy, avoid unnecessary costs, and undesirable heavy side effects for the patient. Given the rapid developments in this field and the translational potential for some of the biomarkers, we will summarize the current state of biomarker research for immunotherapy in melanoma, with an emphasis on omics technologies such as next-generation sequencing and mass cytometry (CyTOF)."

For this reason, chemical analysis of single cells is an expanding area of research nowadays. In this context, metallomics research is going down to the single-cell level, where high-resolution high-sensitive analytical techniques are required. In this chapter, we present the latest developments and applications in the fields of single-cell inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SC-ICP-MS), mass cytometry, laser ablation (LA)-ICP-MS, nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS), and synchrotron X-ray fluorescence microscopy (SXRF) for single-cell analysis.

The clinical success of PD-1 blockade in cHL suggests that the tumor microenvironment (TME) contains reversibly exhausted T effector cells (Teffs). However, durable responses are observed in patients with β2-microglobulin/major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I loss on HRS cells, raising the possibility of non-CD8+ T cell-mediated mechanisms of efficacy of PD-1 blockade. These observations highlight the need for a detailed analysis of the cHL TME. Using a customized time-of-flight mass cytometry panel, we simultaneously assessed cell suspensions from diagnostic cHL biopsies and control reactive lymph node/tonsil (RLNT) samples. Precise phenotyping of immune cell subsets revealed salient differences between cHLs and RLNTs. The TME in cHL is CD4+ T-cell rich, with frequent loss of MHC class I expression on HRS cells. In cHLs, we found concomitant expansion of T helper 1 (Th1)-polarized Teffs and regulatory T cells (Tregs). The cHL Th1 Tregs expressed little or no PD-1, whereas the Th1 Teffs were PD-1+ The differential PD-1 expression and likely functional Th1-polarized CD4+ Tregs and exhausted Teffs may represent complementary mechanisms of immunosuppression in cHL."

However, the phenotype and potential of these heterogenous EPCs remain elusive. In particular, their involvement in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC) remains unclear. The current study extensively characterized the phenotype and functions of EPCs to understand their role in ALC pathogenesis. Methods: Circulating EPCs were identified as CD34+CD133+CD31+ cells by flow cytometer in ALC patients (n = 7) and healthy controls (HC, n = 7). A comprehensive characterization of circulating EPCs using more than 30 phenotype markers was performed by mass cytometer time of flight (CyTOF) in an independent cohort of age and gender matched ALC patients (n = 4) and controls (n = 5). Ex vivo cultures of circulating EPCs from ALC patients (n = 20) and controls (n = 18) were also tested for their functions, including colony formation, LDL uptake, lectin binding and cytokine secretion (ELISA). Results: Three distinct populations of circulating EPCs (CD34+CD133+CD31+) were identified, classified on their CD45 expression (negative: CD45-; intermediate: CD45int; high: CD45hi). CD45int and CD45hi EPCs significantly increased in ALC patients compared to controls (p-val = 0.006). CyTOF data showed that CD45hi EPCs were distinct from CD45- and CD45int EPCs, with higher expression of T cell and myeloid markers, including CD3, CD4, HLA-DR, and chemokine receptors, CCR2, CCR5, CCR7, and CX3CR1. Similar to circulating EPCs, percentage of CD45hiCD34+CD31+ EPCs in ex-vivo cultures from patients, were significantly higher compared to controls (p < 0.05). Cultured EPCs from patients also showed increased LDL uptake, lectin binding and release of TNF-alpha, RANTES, FGF-2, and VEGF. Conclusions: We report the first extensive characterization of circulating human EPCs with distinct EPC subtypes. Increase in CD45hi EPC subtype in ALC patients with enhanced functions, inflammatory cytokines and angiogenic mediators in patients suggests an inflammatory role for these cells in ALC."

CRLF2 protein overexpression leads to activated JAK/STAT signaling and trials are underway using JAK inhibitors to overcome treatment failure. Pre-clinical studies indicated limited efficacy of single JAK inhibitors, thus additional pathways must be targeted in hiCRLF2 cells. To identify additional activated networks, we used single-cell mass cytometry to examine 15 BCP-ALL primary patient samples. We uncovered a coordinated signaling network downstream of CRLF2 characterized by co-activation of JAK/STAT, PI3K, and CREB pathways. This CRLF2-driven network could be more effectively disrupted by SRC/ABL inhibition than single-agent JAK or PI3K inhibition, and this could be demonstrated even in primary minimal residual disease (MRD) cells. Our study suggests SCR/ABL inhibition as effective in disrupting the cooperative functional networks present in hiCRLF2 BCP-ALL patients, supporting further investigation of this strategy in pre-clinical studies."

Visualization of the high-dimensional data with the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding algorithm demonstrated wide diversity of cell-surface marker profiles among CD33+CD71+CD163+ AMs. We then used a κ-nearest neighbor density estimation algorithm to statistically identify distinct alveolar myeloid subtypes, and we discerned 3 AM subtypes defined by CD169 and PD-L1 surface expression. The percentage of AMs that were classified into one of the 3 AM subtypes was significantly different between healthy and mechanically ventilated subjects. In an independent cohort of subjects with ARDS, PD-L1 gene expression and PD-L1/PD-1 pathway-associated gene sets were significantly decreased in AMs from patients who experienced prolonged mechanical ventilation or death.

The current metal-tagged reagent preparation employs thiol-maleimide chemistry to covalently couple maleimide-functionalized metal-chelating polymers (MCPs) with antibodies (Abs), a process that requires partial reduction of the Ab to form reactive thiol groups. However, some classes of Abs (for example, IgM) as well as biomolecules lacking cysteine residues have been challenging to label using this method. This inherent limitation led us to develop a new conjugation strategy for labeling a wide range of biomolecules and affinity reagents. In this report, we present a metal tagging approach using a new class of azide- or transcyclooctene-terminated MCPs with copper(I)-free strain-promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition or tetrazine-alkene click chemistry reactions, in which biomolecules with -NH2 functional groups are selectively activated with a dibenzocyclooctyne or tetrazine moiety, respectively. This approach enabled us to generate highly sensitive and specific metal-tagged IgGs, IgMs, small peptides, and lectins for applications in immunophenotyping and glycobiology. We also created dual-tagged reagents for simultaneous detection of markers by immunofluorescence, mass cytometry, and imaging mass cytometry using a two-step conjugation process. The Helios mass cytometer was used to test the functionality of reagents on suspension human leukemia cell lines and primary cells. The dual-tagged Abs, metal-tagged lectins, and phalloidin staining reagent were used to visualize target proteins and glycans on adherent cell lines and frozen/FFPE tissue sections using the Hyperion Imaging System. In some instances, reagents produced by click conjugation showed superior sensitivity and specificity compared to those of reagents produced by thiol-maleimide chemistry. In general, the click chemistry-based conjugation with new MCPs could be instrumental in developing a wide range of highly sensitive metal-containing reagents for proteomics and glycomics applications."

However, the degree and variability of chromatin modifications in specific human immune cells remain largely unknown. Here, we employ a highly multiplexed mass cytometry analysis to profile the global levels of a broad array of chromatin modifications in primary human immune cells at the single-cell level. Our data reveal markedly different cell-type- and hematopoietic-lineage-specific chromatin modification patterns. Differential analysis between younger and older adults shows that aging is associated with increased heterogeneity between individuals and elevated cell-to-cell variability in chromatin modifications. Analysis of a twin cohort unveils heritability of chromatin modifications and demonstrates that aging-related chromatin alterations are predominantly driven by non-heritable influences. Together, we present a powerful platform for chromatin and immunology research. Our discoveries highlight the profound impacts of aging on chromatin modifications."

While similar to flow cytometry, which is based on detection of fluorophores, one key distinguishing feature of mass cytometry is the detection of atomic masses of lanthanides by mass spectrometry in a mass cytometer. Its superior mass resolution results in lack of signal overlap, thereby allowing multiparametric detection of molecular features in each single cell greater than that of flow cytometry, which is limited to 20 parameters. Unfortunately, most detection in mass cytometry relies on lanthanide-tagged antibodies, which is ideal to detect proteins, but not other types of molecular features. To further expand the repertoire of molecular features that are detectable by mass cytometry, we developed a lanthanide-chelated, azide-containing probe that allows click-chemistry mediated labeling of target molecules. Following incorporation of the thymidine analog 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) during DNA synthesis in S-phase of the cell cycle, we demonstrate that the probe introduced here, tagged with Terbium-159 (159Tb), reacts via copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition (click-chemistry) with Edu. Thus, detection of 159Tb makes it possible to measure DNA synthesis in single cells using mass cytometry. The approach introduced here shows similar sensitivity (true positive rate) to other methods used to measure DNA synthesis in single cells by mass cytometry and is compatible with the parallel antibody-based detection of other parameters in single cells. Due to its universal nature, the use of click-chemistry in mass cytometry expands the types of molecular targets that can be monitored by mass cytometry."

Aging human mammary tissue shows skewed progenitor cell potency, resulting in diminished tumor-suppressive cell types and the accumulation of defective epithelial progenitors. Quantitative characterization of these age-emergent human cell subpopulations is lacking, impeding our understanding of the relationship between age and cancer susceptibility. We conducted single-cell resolution proteomic phenotyping of healthy breast epithelia from 57 women, aged 16-91 years, using mass cytometry. Remarkable heterogeneity was quantified within the two mammary epithelial lineages. Population partitioning identified a subset of aberrant basal-like luminal cells that accumulate with age and originate from age-altered progenitors. Quantification of age-emergent phenotypes enabled robust classification of breast tissues by age in healthy women. This high-resolution mapping highlighted specific epithelial subpopulations that change with age in a manner consistent with increased susceptibility to breast cancer."

Recently, we found that CD161 expression identifies a transcriptional and innate functional phenotype that is shared across various T cell populations. Using mass cytometry and microarray experiments, we demonstrate that this functional phenotype extends to NK cells. CD161 marks NK cells that have retained the ability to respond to innate cytokines during their differentiation, and is lost upon cytomegalovirus-induced maturation in both healthy and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. These pro-inflammatory NK cells are present in the inflamed lamina propria where they are enriched for integrin CD103 expression. Thus, CD161 expression identifies NK cells that may contribute to inflammatory disease pathogenesis and correlates with an innate responsiveness to cytokines in both T and NK cells."

We argue that mass cytometry occupies an important niche within the landscape of single-cell analysis platforms that enables the efficient and in-depth study of diverse immune cell subsets with an ability to zoom-in on myeloid and lymphoid compartments in various tissues in health and disease. We further discuss the unique features of mass cytometry that are favorable for combining multiplex peptide-MHC multimer technology and phenotypic characterization of antigen specific T cells.

Intratumoral heterogeneity poses challenges for cancer treatment, motivating the need for combination therapies. Single-cell technologies are now available to guide effective drug combinations by accounting for intratumoral heterogeneity through the analysis of the signaling perturbations of an individual tumor sample screened by a drug panel. In particular, Mass Cytometry Time-of-Flight (CyTOF) is a high-throughput single-cell technology that enables the simultaneous measurements of multiple ([Formula: see text]40) intracellular and surface markers at the level of single cells for hundreds of thousands of cells in a sample. We developed a computational framework, entitled Drug Nested Effects Models (DRUG-NEM), to analyze CyTOF single-drug perturbation data for the purpose of individualizing drug combinations. DRUG-NEM optimizes drug combinations by choosing the minimum number of drugs that produce the maximal desired intracellular effects based on nested effects modeling.

Here, we combined high-dimensional mass cytometry with T cell receptor repertoire sequencing to interrogate the composition of TFH cells in primary human LNs. We found evidence for intact antigen-driven clonal expansion of TFH cells and selective utilization of specific complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) motifs during chronic HIV infection, but the resulting TFH cells acquired an activation-related TFH cell signature characterized by interleukin-21 (IL-21) dominance. These IL-21+ TFH cells contained an oligoclonal HIV-reactive population that preferentially accumulated in patients with severe HIV infection and was associated with aberrant B cell distribution in the same LN.

The clinical relevance of this immunologic subtyping was investigated with a discriminatory molecular signature derived through comparison of the proteomes and transcriptomes of these 2 immunologic MPM subtypes. This molecular signature, representative of a favorable intratumoral cell network, was independently associated with improved survival in MPM and predicted response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with MPM and melanoma.

Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) and other superantigens have shown to be important factors in TSS, capable of promoting cross-linking between T cell receptors and major histocompatibility complexes which results in overwhelming T cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production. The resulting proinflammatory cytokine cascade, often referred to as the ""cytokine storm,"" seems to be critical to the development of disease. Interestingly, clinical studies have shown that children exhibit less severe TSS-associated morbidity than adults, though the mechanism behind this phenomenon has not been addressed. Indeed, despite the fact that most novel antigen exposure occurs early in life, be it from environmentally acquired pathogens or routine vaccination, normal pediatric T cell immune functions remain critically underexplored. This is largely due to difficulty in obtaining enough samples to explore more than a narrow sliver of the cell-mediated immune compartment. To address this limitation, we optimized a T effector (Teff)/circulating T follicular helper (cTFH) cell mass cytometry panel which allowed us to analyze a wide array of T cell populations and effector functions following in vitro SEB stimulation. We show that T cell activation-as measured by CD69 expression-following SEB stimulation is lower in pediatric participants, increasing throughout childhood, and reaching adult levels by around 15 years old. Further, while individual CD4+ effector memory T cell (TEM) effector molecules show limited age-associated differences following SEB stimulation, multifunctional CD4+ TEM are shown to positively correlate with increasing age through adolescence. Individual CD8+ TEM effectors and multifunctional phenotypes also show very strong age-associated increases following SEB stimulation. SEB stimulation has little impact on cTFH activation or functional cellular markers, regardless of age. These results, coupled with the fact that a robust proinflammatory cytokine response seems critical to developing severe TSS, suggest a possible connection between the significantly reduced T cell activation and multifunctional populations following in vitro SEB stimulation in our pediatric participants and clinical observations relating to reduced TSS mortality in children."

Nevertheless, immunologists often face an important problem concerning the choice of markers to be included in a panel. This problem arises due to the incompatibility of different buffers used for the fixation and permeabilization of cells with various cell surface epitopes. In this study, we used a panel of 27 markers (19 surface markers and 8 intranuclear markers) to demonstrate disparities in the detection of cell surface antigens when comparing different buffers to stain unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These disparities range from mild differences to very important differences in population frequencies depending on the buffers.

New metabololipidomic approaches with mass spectrometry presented in this brief review can now be utilized for the identification and profiling of lipid mediator networks that control inflammation-resolution in human blood and healthy and diseased solid tissues. Coagulation of blood is a protective response that prevents excessive bleeding on injury of blood vessels. Here, we review novel approaches to understand the relationship(s) between coagulation and resolution of inflammation and infection. To determine whether coagulation is involved in host-protective actions by lipid mediators, we used a metabololipidomic-based profiling approach with human whole blood (WB) during coagulation. We identified recently temporal clusters of endogenously produced pro-thrombotic and proinflammatory lipid mediators (eicosanoids), as well as specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) in this vital process. In addition to the classic eicosanoids (prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes), a specific SPM cluster was identified that consists of resolvin E1 (RvE1), RvD1, RvD5, lipoxin B4, and maresin 1, each of which present at bioactive concentrations (0.1-1 nM). The removal of adenosine from coagulating blood samples significantly enhances SPM amounts and unleashes the biosynthesis of RvD3, RvD4, and RvD6 evident following rapid snap freezing with centrifugation before extraction and LC-MS-MS. The classic cyclooxygenase inhibitors, celecoxib and indomethacin, that block thromboxanes and prostanoids do not block production of the clot-driven SPM cluster. Unbiased mass cytometry analysis demonstrated that the SPM cluster produced in human blood targets leukocytes at the single-cell level, directly activating extracellular signaling in human neutrophils and monocytes. Human whole blood treated with the components of this SPM cluster enhanced both phagocytosis and killing of Escherichia coli by leukocytes. Thus, we identified a pro-resolving lipid mediator circuit and specific SPM cluster that promotes host defense. This new lipid mediator (LM)-SPM metabololipidomic approach now provides accessible metabolomic profiles in healthy and diseased human tissues, including cancer, for precision and personalized medicine."

The formation of ulcers is due to repeated cycles of ischemia-reperfusion (IR), which initiates an inflammatory response. Advanced ulcers disrupt the skin barrier, resulting in further complications. To date, the immunological aspect of skin IR has been understudied, partly due to the complexity of the skin immune cells. Through a combination of mass cytometry, confocal imaging and intravital multiphoton imaging, this study establishes a workflow for multidimensionality single cell analysis of skin myeloid cell responses in the context of IR injury with high spatiotemporal resolution. The data generated has provided us with previously uncharacterized insights into the distinct cellular behavior of resident dendritic cells (DCs) and recruited neutrophils post IR. Of interest, we observed a drop in DDC numbers in the IR region, which was subsequently replenished 48h post IR. More importantly, in these cells, we observe an attenuated response to repeated injuries, which may have implications in the subsequent wound healing process."

We identified three myeloid cell populations exclusive to the CNS and present in each disease model. Blood-derived monocytes comprised five populations and migrated to the brain in EAE, but not in HD and ALS models. Single-cell analysis resolved differences in signaling and cytokine production within similar myeloid populations in EAE compared to HD and ALS models. Moreover, these analyses highlighted α5 integrin on myeloid cells as a potential therapeutic target for neuroinflammation. Together, these findings illustrate how neuropathology may differ between inflammatory and degenerative brain disease."

Here we report a single-cell-based study of B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia at diagnosis that reveals hidden developmentally dependent cell signaling states that are uniquely associated with relapse. By using mass cytometry we simultaneously quantified 35 proteins involved in B cell development in 60 primary diagnostic samples. Each leukemia cell was then matched to its nearest healthy B cell population by a developmental classifier that operated at the single-cell level. Machine learning identified six features of expanded leukemic populations that were sufficient to predict patient relapse at diagnosis. These features implicated the pro-BII subpopulation of B cells with activated mTOR signaling, and the pre-BI subpopulation of B cells with activated and unresponsive pre-B cell receptor signaling, to be associated with relapse. This model, termed 'developmentally dependent predictor of relapse' (DDPR), significantly improves currently established risk stratification methods. DDPR features exist at diagnosis and persist at relapse. By leveraging a data-driven approach, we demonstrate the predictive value of single-cell 'omics' for patient stratification in a translational setting and provide a framework for its application to human cancer."

Genomic analysis of RMS has revealed that alterations in the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/RAS/PI3K axis are common and that FGFR4 is frequently mutated or overexpressed. Although FGFR4 is a potentially druggable receptor tyrosine kinase, its functions in RMS are undefined. This study tested FGFR4-activating mutations and overexpression for the ability to generate RMS in mice. Murine tumor models were subsequently used to discover potential therapeutic targets and to test a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor in a preclinical setting. Specifically, we provide the first mechanistic evidence of differential potency in the most common human RMS mutations, V550E or N535K, compared to FGFR4wt overexpression as murine myoblasts expressing FGFR4V550E undergo higher rates of cellular transformation, engraftment into mice, and rapidly form sarcomas that highly resemble human RMS. Murine tumor cells overexpressing FGFR4V550E were tested in an in vitro dose-response drug screen along with human RMS cell lines. Compounds were grouped by target class, and potency was determined using average percentage of area under the dose-response curve (AUC). RMS cells were highly sensitive to PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, in particular, GSK2126458 (omipalisib) was a potent inhibitor of FGFR4V550E tumor-derived cell and human RMS cell viability. FGFR4V550E-overexpressing myoblasts and tumor cells had low nanomolar GSK2126458 EC50 values. Mass cytometry using mouse and human RMS cell lines validated GSK2126458 specificity at single-cell resolution, decreasing the abundance of phosphorylated Akt as well as decreasing phosphorylation of the downstream mTOR effectors 4ebp1, Eif4e, and S6. Moreover, PI3K/mTOR inhibition also robustly decreased the growth of RMS tumors in vivo. Thus, by developing a preclinical platform for testing novel therapies, we identified PI3K/mTOR inhibition as a promising new therapy for this devastating pediatric cancer."

These cells have a profound impact on antitumor immunity and influence fundamental processes that underlie malignancy, including neoangiogenesis, sustained cancer cell proliferation, metastasis and therapy resistance. For these reasons, development of therapeutic approaches to deplete or reprogram myeloid cells in cancer is an emerging field of interest. However, knowledge about the heterogeneity of myeloid cells in tumors and their variability between patients and disease stages is still limited. In this review, we summarize the most recent advances in our understanding about how the phenotype of tumor-associated macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, myeloid-derived suppressor cells and dendritic cells is dictated by their ontogeny, activation status and localization. We also outline major open questions that will only be resolved by applying high-dimensional single-cell technologies and systems biology approaches in the analysis of the tumor microenvironment."

By using antibodies (or other probes) labeled with purified metal isotopes, mass cytometers are currently able to detect more than 50 different parameters at a single-cell level, exceeding the dimensionality of any other flow cytometry methodology currently on the market. This capability licenses unprecedented possibilities in many areas dealing with complex cellular mixtures (immunology, cell biology, and beyond), improving biomarker discovery and moving us closer to affordable personalized medicine than before."

In modern research of cellular heterogeneity, there are four major approaches: analysis of pooled samples, single-cell analysis, high-throughput single-cell analysis, and lately integrated analysis of cellular population at a single-cell level. Recently developed high-throughput single-cell genetic analysis methods such as RNA-Seq require purification step and destruction of an analyzed cell often are providing a snapshot of the investigated cell without spatiotemporal context. Correlative analysis of multiparameter morphological, functional, and molecular information is important for differentiation of more uniform groups in the spectrum of different cell types. Simplified distributions (histograms and 2D plots) can underrepresent biologically significant subpopulations. Future directions may include the development of nondestructive methods for dissecting molecular events in intact cells, simultaneous correlative cellular analysis of phenotypic and molecular features by hybrid technologies such as imaging flow cytometry, and further progress in supervised and non-supervised statistical analysis algorithms."

Although it is established that neutrophils are derived from the granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP), the differentiation pathways from GMP to functional mature neutrophils are poorly defined. Using mass cytometry (CyTOF) and cell-cycle-based analysis, we identified three neutrophil subsets within the BM: a committed proliferative neutrophil precursor (preNeu) which differentiates into non-proliferating immature neutrophils and mature neutrophils. Transcriptomic profiling and functional analysis revealed that preNeu require the C/EBPε transcription factor for their generation from the GMP, and their proliferative program is substituted by a gain of migratory and effector function as they mature. preNeus expand under microbial and tumoral stress, and immature neutrophils are recruited to the periphery of tumor-bearing mice. In summary, our study identifies specialized BM granulocytic populations that ensure supply under homeostasis and stress responses."

Epub 2018 Feb 20.,Article has no keywords,"Purpose: Wnt/β-catenin signaling is required for leukemic stem cell function. FLT3 mutations are frequently observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Anomalous FLT3 signaling increases β-catenin nuclear localization and transcriptional activity. FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are used clinically to treat FLT3-mutated AML patients, but with limited efficacy. We investigated the antileukemia activity of combined Wnt/β-catenin and FLT3 inhibition in FLT3-mutant AML.Experimental Design: Wnt/β-catenin signaling was inhibited by the β-catenin/CBP antagonist C-82/PRI-724 or siRNAs, and FLT3 signaling by sorafenib or quizartinib. Treatments on apoptosis, cell growth, and cell signaling were assessed in cell lines, patient samples, and in vivo in immunodeficient mice by flow cytometry, Western blot, RT-PCR, and CyTOF.Results: We found significantly higher β-catenin expression in cytogenetically unfavorable and relapsed AML patient samples and in the bone marrow-resident leukemic cells compared with circulating blasts. Disrupting Wnt/β-catenin signaling suppressed AML cell growth, induced apoptosis, abrogated stromal protection, and synergized with TKIs in FLT3-mutated AML cells and stem/progenitor cells in vitro The aforementioned combinatorial treatment improved survival of AML-xenografted mice in two in vivo models and impaired leukemia cell engraftment. Mechanistically, the combined inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin and FLT3 cooperatively decreased nuclear β-catenin and the levels of c-Myc and other Wnt/β-catenin and FLT3 signaling proteins. Importantly, β-catenin inhibition abrogated the microenvironmental protection afforded the leukemic stem/progenitor cells.Conclusions: Disrupting Wnt/β-catenin signaling exerts potent activities against AML stem/progenitor cells and synergizes with FLT3 inhibition in FLT3-mutant AML.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of QFMatch by evaluating sample datasets from immunology studies. The algorithm is based on a novel multivariate extension of the quadratic form distance for the comparison of flow cytometry data sets. We show that this QF distance has attractive computational and statistical properties that make it well suited for analysis tasks that involve the comparison of flow/mass cytometry samples."

One goal is to account for the distributions of proteins from single-cell measurements by flow cytometry or mass cytometry as readout of biological regulation. In that context, large cell-to-cell variability is often observed in biological quantities. We show here that these readouts, viewed in logarithmic scale may result in two easily-distinguishable modes, while the underlying distribution (in linear scale) is unimodal. We introduce a simple mathematical test to highlight this mismatch. We then dissect the flow of influence of cell-to-cell variability proposing a graphical model which motivates higher-dimensional analysis of the data. Finally we show how acquiring additional biological information can be used to reduce uncertainty introduced by cell-to-cell variability, helping to clarify whether the data is uni- or bimodal.

The numbers of neutrophils, monocytes, and dendritic cells were transiently affected by vaccination, but without any major difference between prime and boost. However, phenotyping deeper those cells with mass cytometry unveiled their high phenotypic diversity with subsets responding differently after each injection, some enriched only after the primary injection and others only after the boost. Actually, the composition in subphenotype already differed just before the boost as compared to just before the prime. Multivariate analysis identified the key features that contributed to these differences. Cell subpopulations best characterizing the post-boost response were more activated, with a stronger expression of markers involved in phagocytosis, antigen presentation, costimulation, chemotaxis, and inflammation. This study revisits innate immunity by demonstrating that, like adaptive immunity, innate myeloid responses differ after one or two immunizations."

In addition to a dominant cell subset, each tumor harbored rarer cell phenotypes. One such group co-expressed E-cadherin and vimentin (EV), suggesting their potential role in epithelial mesenchymal transition, which was substantiated by pairwise correlation analyses. Furthermore, tumors from patients with poorer outcome had an increased frequency of another rare cell type that co-expressed vimentin, HE4, and cMyc. These poorer-outcome tumors also populated more cell phenotypes, as quantified by Simpson's diversity index. Thus, despite the recognized genomic complexity of the disease, the specific cell phenotypes uncovered here offer a focus for therapeutic intervention and disease monitoring."

The use of optical coherence tomography to perform optical biopsies during endoscopic ultrasound procedures or visualize cells within effusion samples is discussed. The potential for quantitative phase microscopy to accurately screen Pap test slides or resolve indeterminate diagnoses in urine cytology is reviewed. The article also examines the application of 3D cytology using LuCED for lung cancer detection in sputum samples and the feasibility of imaging flow and mass cytometry to measure multiple biomarkers at the single cell level. Although these novel technologies have great potential, further research is necessary to validate their routine use in cytopathology practice."

It has been challenging to map leukocytes across the entire brain, and in particular in pathology, where phenotypic changes and influx of blood-derived cells prevent a clear distinction between reactive leukocyte populations. Here, we applied high-dimensional single-cell mass and fluorescence cytometry, in parallel with genetic fate mapping systems, to identify, locate, and characterize multiple distinct immune populations within the mammalian CNS. Using this approach, we revealed that microglia, several subsets of border-associated macrophages and dendritic cells coexist in the CNS at steady state and exhibit disease-specific transformations in the immune microenvironment during aging and in models of Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. Together, these data and the described framework provide a resource for the study of disease mechanisms, potential biomarkers, and therapeutic targets in CNS disease."

Epub 2018 Mar 6.,Keywords: IMC; high-throughput histology; imaging mass cytometry; metal counterstaining; next-generation immunohistochemistry; ruthenium tetroxide.,"Imaging mass cytometry is a novel imaging modality that enables simultaneous antibody-based detection of >40 epitopes and molecules in tissue sections at subcellular resolution by the use of isotopically pure metal tags. Essential for any imaging approach in which antigen detection is performed is counterstaining, which reveals the overall structure of the tissue. Counterstaining is necessary because antigens of interest are often present in only a small subset of cells, and the rest of the tissue structures are not visible. As most biological tissues are nearly transparent or non-fluorescent, chromogenic reagents such as haematoxylin (for immunohistochemistry) or fluorescent dyes such as 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (which stains nuclei for epifluorescence and confocal microscopy) are utilized. Here, we describe a metal-based counterstain for imaging mass cytometry based on simple oxidation and subsequent covalent binding of the tissue components to ruthenium tetroxide (RuO4 ). RuO4 counterstaining reveals general tissue structure both in areas with high cell content and in stromal areas with low cellularity and fibrous or hyaline material in a manner analogous to haematoxylin in immunohistochemical counterstaining or eosin or other anionic dyes in conventional histology. Our new counterstain approach is applicable to any metal-based imaging technique, and will facilitate the adaptation of imaging mass cytometry for routine applications in clinical and research laboratories.

They act in concert with other immune and nonimmune cells via cytokine-mediated communication and direct cell-cell interactions. Understanding the complex immune network requires a broad characterization of its individual cellular components. This is especially relevant for the brain compartment, which is an active immunological site, composed of resident and infiltrating immune cells that affect brain development, tissue homeostasis and neuronal activity. Mass cytometry, or CyTOF (cytometry by time-of-flight), uses metal-conjugated antibodies to enable a high-dimensional description of tens of markers at the single-cell level, thereby providing a bird's-eye view of the immune system. This technique has been successfully applied to the discovery of novel immune populations in humans and rodents. Here, we provide a step-by-step description of a mass cytometry approach for the analysis of the mouse brain compartment. The different stages of the procedure include brain perfusion, extraction of the brain tissue and its dissociation into a single-cell suspension, followed by cell staining with metal-tagged antibodies, sample reading using a mass cytometer, and data analysis using SPADE and viSNE. This procedure takes <5 h (excluding data analysis) and can be applied to study modifications in the brain's immune populations under normal and pathological conditions."

Originally defined on the functional basis of their ""natural"" ability to lyse tumor targets and thought to be a relatively homogeneous group of lymphocytes, NK cells possess a remarkable degree of phenotypic and functional diversity due to the combinatorial expression of an array of activating and inhibitory receptors. Diversification of NK cells is multifaceted: mechanisms of NK cell education that promote self-tolerance result in a heterogeneous repertoire that further diversifies upon encounters with viral pathogens. Here, we review the genetic, developmental, and environmental sources of NK cell diversity with a particular focus on deep profiling and single-cell technologies that will enable a more thorough and accurate dissection of this intricate and poorly understood lymphocyte lineage."

While developed for cell type analysis, MEM labels can be generated for a wide range of multidimensional data types, and MEM works effectively with output from expert analysis and diverse machine learning algorithms. MEM is implemented as an R package and includes three steps: (1) calculation of MEM values that quantify each feature's relative enrichment in the population, (2) reporting of MEM labels as a heatmap or as a text label, and (3) quantification of MEM label similarity between populations. The protocols here show MEM analysis using datasets from immunology and oncology. These MEM implementations provide a way to characterize population identity and novelty in the context of computational and expert analyses. © 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc."

Here we used high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry and a bioinformatics pipeline for the in-depth characterization of the immune cell subsets in the peripheral blood of patients with stage IV melanoma before and after 12 weeks of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. During therapy, we observed a clear response to immunotherapy in the T cell compartment. However, before commencing therapy, a strong predictor of progression-free and overall survival in response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy was the frequency of CD14+CD16-HLA-DRhi monocytes. We confirmed this by conventional flow cytometry in an independent, blinded validation cohort, and we propose that the frequency of monocytes in PBMCs may serve in clinical decision support."

Epub 2018 Jan 4.,Keywords: Data analysis; Drug screens; Flow-cytometry; Hyperspectral cytometry; Multiplexed assays; Plate Analyzer.,"Flow cytometry has well-established methods for data analysis based on traditional data collection techniques. These techniques typically involved manual insertion of tube samples into an instrument that, historically, could only measure 1-3 colors. The field has since evolved to incorporate new technologies for faster and highly automated sample preparation and data collection. For example, the use of microwell plates on benchtop instruments is now a standard on virtually every new instrument, and so users can easily accumulate multiple data sets quickly. Further, because the user must carefully define the layout of the plate, this information is already defined when considering the analytical process, expanding the opportunities for automated analysis. Advances in multi-parametric data collection, as demonstrated by the development of hyperspectral flow-cytometry, 20-40 color polychromatic flow cytometry, and mass cytometry (CyTOF), are game-changing. As data and assay complexity increase, so too does the complexity of data analysis. Complex data analysis is already a challenge to traditional flow cytometry software. New methods for reviewing large and complex data sets can provide rapid insight into processes difficult to define without more advanced analytical tools. In settings such as clinical labs where rapid and accurate data analysis is a priority, rapid, efficient and intuitive software is needed. This paper outlines opportunities for analysis of complex data sets using examples of multiplexed bead-based assays, drug screens and cell cycle analysis - any of which could become integrated into the clinical environment."

Metabolites display diverse effector mechanisms, including targeting protein synthesis, cell cycle status, DNA damage repair, necrosis, apoptosis, or phosphoprotein signaling. Arrayed metabolites are tested against acute myeloid leukemia patient bone marrow and molecules that specifically targeted blast cells or nonleukemic immune cell subsets within the same tissue biopsy are revealed.

Here, we explored comprehensive immune-cell responses associated with clinical benefits using PBMCs from patients with malignant melanoma treated with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody. Pre- and post-treatment samples were collected from two different cohorts (discovery set and validation set) and subjected to mass cytometry assays that measured the expression levels of 35 proteins. Screening by high dimensional clustering in the discovery set identified increases in three micro-clusters of CD4+ T cells, a subset of central memory CD4+ T cells harboring the CD27+FAS-CD45RA-CCR7+ phenotype, after treatment in long-term survivors, but not in non-responders. The same increase was also observed in clinical responders in the validation set. We propose that increases in this subset of central memory CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood can be potentially used as a predictor of clinical response to PD-1 blockade therapy in patients with malignant melanoma."

Hepatitis due to immunotherapy with antibodies against PD-1 is uncommon and generally of low severity. We present an unusually severe case arising in a melanoma patient after more than 6 months uncomplicated treatment with anti-PD-1 in an adjuvant setting. The hepatitis rapidly developed resistance to high-dose steroids, requiring anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) to achieve control. Mass cytometry allowed comprehensive phenotyping of circulating lymphocytes and revealed that CD4+ T cells were profoundly depleted by ATG, while CD8+ T cells, B cells, NK cells and monocytes were relatively spared. Multiple abnormalities in CD4+ T cell phenotype were stably present in the patient before disease onset. These included a population of CCR4-CCR6- effector/memory CD4+ T cells expressing intermediate levels of the Th1-related chemokine receptor CXCR3 and abnormally high multi-drug resistance type 1 transporter (MDR1) activity as assessed by a rhodamine 123 excretion assay. Expression of MDR1 has been implicated in steroid resistance and may have contributed to the severity and lack of a sustained steroid response in this patient. The number of CD4+ rhodamine 123-excreting cells was reduced > 3.5-fold after steroid and ATG treatment. This case illustrates the need to consider this form of steroid resistance in patients failing treatment with corticosteroids. It also highlights the need for both better identification of patients at risk and the development of treatments that involve more specific immune suppression."

This requires delineating the expression of surface markers by DC subsets among individuals and tissues. Here, we performed a multiparametric phenotypic characterization and unbiased analysis of human DC subsets in blood, tonsil, spleen, and skin. We uncovered previously unreported phenotypic heterogeneity of human cDC2s among individuals, including variable expression of functional receptors such as CD172a. We found marked differences in DC subsets localized in blood and lymphoid tissues versus skin, and a striking absence of the newly discovered Axl+ DCs in the skin. Finally, we evaluated the capacity of anti-receptor monoclonal antibodies to deliver vaccine components to skin DC subsets. These results offer a promising path for developing DC subset-specific immunotherapies that cannot be provided by transcriptomic analysis alone."

Multiphoton microscopy of kidney sections confirmed that most of the dendritically shaped CD11c+ cells forming a network throughout the renal interstitium expressed macrophage-specific markers. In contrast, DCs marked by Zbtb46-GFP or Snx22-GFP were less abundant, concentrated around blood vessels, and round in shape. We confirmed this pattern of localization using imaging mass cytometry. Motility measurements showed that resident macrophages were sessile, whereas DCs were motile before and after inflammation. Although uninflamed glomeruli rarely contained DCs, injury with nephrotoxic antibodies resulted in accumulation of ZBTB46 + cells in the periglomerular region. ZBTB46 identifies all classic DCs, which can be categorized into two functional subsets that express either CD103 or CD11b. Depletion of ZBTB46 + cells attenuated the antibody-induced kidney injury, whereas deficiency of the CD103+ subset accelerated injury through a mechanism that involved increased neutrophil infiltration. RNA sequencing 7 days after nephrotoxic antibody injection showed that CD11b+ DCs expressed the neutrophil-attracting cytokine CXCL2, whereas CD103+ DCs expressed high levels of several anti-inflammatory genes. These results provide new insights into the distinct functions of the two major DC subsets in glomerular inflammation."

Using elemental reporters composed of stable heavy metal isotopes, more than 50 cellular parameters are measured simultaneously. However, this current multiplexing does not meet the theoretical capability of CyTOF instrumentation with 135 detectable channels, primarily due to the limitation of available chemistries for conjugating elemental mass tags to affinity reagents. To address this issue, we develop herein additional metallic mass tag based on bismuth-209 (209 Bi) for efficient conjugation to monoclonal antibody. This enables the use of an addtional channel m/z = 209 of CyTOF for single-cell immunoassays. Bismuth has nearly the same charge-to-radius ratio as lanthanide elements; thus, bismuth(III) cations (209 Bi3+ ) could coordinate with DTPA chelators in the same geometry of O- and N-donor groups as that of lanthanide. In this report, the coordination chemistry of 209 Bi3+ with DTPA chelators and Maxpar® X8 polymers were investigated in details. Accordingly, the protocols of conjugating antibody with bismuth mass tag were provided. A method based on UV-Vis absorbance at 280 nm of 209 Bi3+ -labeling DTPA complexes was developed to evaluate the stoichiometric ratio of 209 Bi3+ cations to the conjugated antibody. Side-by-side single-cell analysis experiments with bismuth- and lanthanide-tagged antibodies were carried out to compare the analytical sensitivities. The measurement accuracy of bismuth-tagged antibody was validated within in vitro assay using primary human natural killer cells. Furthermore, bismuth-tagged antibodies were successfully employed in cell cycle measurements and high-dimensional phenotyping immunoassays. © 2017 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry."

Epub 2017 Nov 30.,Keywords: RNA; branched DNA; imaging; in situ hybridization; lanthanides; mass cytometry; protein; single cell.,"Mass cytometry uniquely enables high-dimensional single-cell analysis of complex populations. This recently developed technology is based on inductively coupled time-of-flight mass spectrometry for multiplex proteomic analysis of more than 40 markers per cell. The ability to characterize the transcriptome is critical for the understanding of disease pathophysiology, medical diagnostics, and drug discovery. Current techniques allowing the in situ detection of transcripts in single cells are limited to a small number of simultaneous targets and are generally tedious and labor-intensive. In this report, we present the development of a multiplex method for targeted RNA detection by combining the mass cytometry and RNAscope® platforms. This novel assay, called Metal In Situ Hybridization (MISH), includes the hybridization of RNA-specific target probes followed by signal amplification achieved through a cascade of hybridization events, ending with the binding of amplifier-specific detector probes. The detector probes are tagged with isotopically pure metal atoms used for detection by mass cytometry. Proof-of-principle experiments show the simultaneous detection of three mRNA targets in Jurkat cells in suspension cell assay mode. The localization of transcripts was also investigated using the imaging mass cytometry platform in Jurkat and KG-1a cells. In addition, we optimized the antibody staining procedure to allow the co-detection of mRNA and cell surface markers. Our data demonstrate that MISH can be used to complement protein detection by mass cytometry as well as to investigate gene transcription and translation in single cells. © 2017 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry."

Independent functional characterization of human Th1, Th2, Th17, T follicular helper (Tfh), Treg, and Tr1 cells has helped to define unique surface molecules, transcription factors, and signaling profiles for each subset. However, the adequacy of these markers to recapitulate the whole CD3+CD4+ T cell compartment remains questionable. In this study, we examined CD3+CD4+ T cell populations by single-cell mass cytometry. We characterize the CD3+CD4+ Th, Treg, and Tr1 cell populations simultaneously across 23 memory T cell-associated surface and intracellular molecules. High-dimensional analysis identified several new subsets, in addition to the already defined CD3+CD4+ Th, Treg, and Tr1 cell populations, for a total of 11 Th cell, 4 Treg, and 1 Tr1 cell subsets. Some of these subsets share markers previously thought to be selective for Treg, Th1, Th2, Th17, and Tfh cells, including CD194 (CCR4)+FOXP3+ Treg and CD183 (CXCR3)+T-bet+ Th17 cell subsets. Unsupervised clustering displayed a phenotypic organization of CD3+CD4+ T cells that confirmed their diversity but showed interrelation between the different subsets, including similarity between Th1-Th2-Tfh cell populations and Th17 cells, as well as similarity of Th2 cells with Treg cells. In conclusion, the use of single-cell mass cytometry provides a systems-level characterization of CD3+CD4+ T cells in healthy human blood, which represents an important baseline reference to investigate abnormalities of different subsets in immune-mediated pathologies."

Epub 2017 Nov 23.,Keywords: AML; Immunotherapy; Mass cytometry; Microenvironment.,"A hallmark of the development of cancer is its ability to avoid detection and elimination by the immune system. There are many identified mechanisms of this immune evasion that can be measured both phenotypically and functionally. Functional studies directly show the ability of the tumor microenvironment to suppress immune responses, typically measured as lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine production or killing ability. While a direct measurement of function is ideal, these assays require ex vivo activation which may not accurately mimic in vivo conditions. Phenotypic assays can directly measure the distribution and activation of immune cell types rapidly after isolation, preserving the conditions present in the patient. While conventional flow cytometry is a rapid and well established assay, it currently allows for measurement of only 12-14 parameters. Mass spectrometry-based flow cytometry, or CyTOF, offers the ability to measure 3-fold more parameters than conventional optical-based modalities providing an advantage in depth of analysis that can be crucial for precious human samples. The goal of this report is to describe the system our group has developed to measure both the phenotype and function of immune cells in the bone marrow of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. We hope to explain our system in the context of previous studies aimed at measuring immune status in tumors and to inform the reader as to some experimental approaches our group has found useful in developing the basic data required to rationally pursue immune-based therapies for patients with cancer."

We present the results of a six-center study using healthy control human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and commercially available reagents to test the intra-site and inter-site variation of mass cytometers and operators. We used prestained controls generated by the primary center as a reference to compare against samples stained at each individual center. Data were analyzed at the primary center, including investigating the effects of two normalization methods. All six sites performed similarly, with CVs for both Frequency of Parent and median signal intensity (MSI) values<30%. Increased background was seen when using the premixed antibody cocktail aliquots at each site, suggesting that cocktails are best made fresh. Both normalization methods tested performed adequately for normalizing MSI values between centers. Clustering algorithms revealed slight differences between the prestained and the sites-stained samples, due mostly to the increased background of a few antibodies. Therefore, we believe that multicenter mass cytometry assays are feasible."

Here we introduce Hierarchical Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (HSNE) for the analysis of mass cytometry data sets. HSNE constructs a hierarchy of non-linear similarities that can be interactively explored with a stepwise increase in detail up to the single-cell level. We apply HSNE to a study on gastrointestinal disorders and three other available mass cytometry data sets. We find that HSNE efficiently replicates previous observations and identifies rare cell populations that were previously missed due to downsampling. Thus, HSNE removes the scalability limit of conventional t-SNE analysis, a feature that makes it highly suitable for the analysis of massive high-dimensional data sets."

In the current study we evaluated L-, P- and E-selectin binding to neuroblastoma cells and the expression of some of their known ligands, namely CD44, CD24 and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1). Genetic loss of PSGL-1 or CD24 and pharmacological inhibition of P-selectin reduced P-selectin binding to neuroblastoma cells in vitro. Targeting P-selectin using specific antibodies promoted a significant reduction in the growth of neuroblastoma tumors in vivo. In mechanistic studies binding of P-selectin to neuroblastoma cells activated Src and several other pro-survival kinases such as ERK1, AKT, FAK and p38. Interestingly, comparative mass single cell cytometry (CyTOF) analyses revealed considerable intra- and inter-cell line heterogeneity with respect to response to P-selectin binding. Additionally, the downstream response to all selectins showed general similarity. Our findings reported here not only provide pre-clinical evidence in support of therapeutic targeting of P-selectin, but also highlight the heterogeneity in response of tumor cells to P-selectin binding. These observations provide the basis for combining P-selectin inhibition with other targeted therapies for neuroblastoma."

We have applied p-Creode to mass cytometry, multiplex immunofluorescence, and single-cell RNA-seq data. As a test case, we validate cell-state-transition trajectories predicted by p-Creode for intestinal tuft cells, a rare, chemosensory cell type. We clarify that tuft cells are specified outside of the Atoh1-dependent secretory lineage in the small intestine. However, p-Creode also predicts, and we confirm, that tuft cells arise from an alternative, Atoh1-driven developmental program in the colon. These studies introduce p-Creode as a reliable method for analyzing large datasets that depict branching transition trajectories."

Mass cytometry has tremendous potential for the analysis of highly complex clinical samples for the diagnosis and monitoring of malignant and autoimmune disorders. The technology also presents several unique challenges for clinical use and will require new approaches to analyze the large amounts of data generated.

Here, we describe a new mechanism of Treg self-inflicted damage. We show that granzymes A and -B (GrA and GrB), which are highly upregulated in human Tregs upon stimulation, leak out of cytotoxic granules to induce cleavage of cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates, precipitating apoptosis in target cells. GrA and GrB substrates were protected from cleavage by inhibiting granzyme activity in vitro. Additionally, we show - by using cytometry by time of flight (CYTOF) - an increase in GrB-expressing Tregs in the peripheral blood and renal allografts of transplant recipients undergoing rejection. These GrB-expressing Tregs showed an activated phenotype but were significantly more apoptotic than non-GrB expressing Tregs. This potentially novel finding improves our understanding of Treg survival and suggests that manipulating Gr expression or activity might be useful for designing more effective Treg therapies."

Here, we describe a human interleukin 15 (IL15) and human signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPA) knock-in mouse on a Rag2-/- Il2rg-/- background (SRG-15). Transplantation of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells into SRG-15 mice dramatically improved the development and functional maturation of circulating and tissue-resident human NK and CD8+ T cells and promoted the development of tissue-resident innate lymphoid cell (ILC) subsets. Profiling of human NK cell subsets by mass cytometry revealed a highly similar expression pattern of killer inhibitory receptors and other candidate molecules in NK cell subpopulations between SRG-15 mice and humans. In contrast to nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient Il2rg-/- (NSG) mice, human NK cells in SRG-15 mice did not require preactivation but infiltrated a Burkitt's lymphoma xenograft and efficiently inhibited tumor growth following treatment with the therapeutic antibody rituximab.

This method describes the use of mass cytometry for the analysis of cell cycle state for cells from three different sources: in vitro cultured cell lines, ex vivo human blood or bone marrow, and in vivo labeling and ex vivo analysis of murine tissues. The method utilizes incorporation of 5-Iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (IdU), combined with measurement of phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRb), cyclin B1, and phosphorylated histone H3 (p-HH3). These measurements can be integrated into a gating strategy that allows for clear separation of all five phases of the cell cycle."

Epub 2017 Oct 10.,Article has no keywords,"Purpose: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC) has a much better prognosis than HPV-negative OPSCC, and this is linked to dense tumor immune infiltration. As the viral antigens may trigger potent immunity, we studied the relationship between the presence of intratumoral HPV-specific T-cell responses, the immune contexture in the tumor microenvironment, and clinical outcome.Experimental Design: To this purpose, an in-depth analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in a prospective cohort of 97 patients with HPV16-positive and HPV16-negative OPSCC was performed using functional T-cell assays, mass cytometry (CyTOF), flow cytometry, and fluorescent immunostaining of tumor tissues. Key findings were validated in a cohort of 75 patients with HPV16-positive OPSCC present in the publicly available The Cancer Genome Atlas database.Results: In 64% of the HPV16-positive tumors, type I HPV16-specific T cells were present. Their presence was not only strongly related to a better overall survival, a smaller tumor size, and less lymph node metastases but also to a type I-oriented tumor microenvironment, including high numbers of activated CD161+ T cells, CD103+ tissue-resident T cells, dendritic cells (DC), and DC-like macrophages.Conclusions: The viral antigens trigger a tumor-specific T-cell response that shapes a favorable immune contexture for the response to standard therapy. Hence, reinforcement of HPV16-specific T-cell reactivity is expected to boost this process. Clin Cancer Res; 24(3); 634-47. ©2017 AACRSee related commentary by Laban and Hoffmann, p. 505."

It is composed of diverse cell types with functions such as extracellular matrix maintenance, blood and lymph vessel development, and effector cell recruitment. The tissue microenvironment is determined by the molecular characteristics and relative abundances of different stromal cells such as fibroblasts, endothelial cells, pericytes, and mesenchymal precursor cells. Stromal cell heterogeneity is explained by embryonic developmental lineage, stages of differentiation to other cell types, and activation states. Interaction between immune and stromal cell types is critical to wound healing, cancer, and a wide range of inflammatory diseases. Here, we review recent studies of inflammatory diseases that use functional genomics and single-cell technologies to identify and characterize stromal cell types associated with pathogenesis."

In this work, we apply state-of-the art causal discovery methods on a large collection of public mass cytometry data sets, measuring intra-cellular signaling proteins of the human immune system and their response to several perturbations. We show how different experimental conditions can be used to facilitate causal discovery, and apply two fundamental methods that produce context-specific causal predictions. Causal predictions were reproducible across independent data sets from two different studies, but often disagree with the KEGG pathway databases. Within this context, we discuss the caveats we need to overcome for automated causal discovery to become a part of the routine data analysis in systems biology."

Although expected to be functionally suppressed, we found that the population of intratumoral PD-1+ T cells were predominantly responsible for production of cytokines and granules. This surprising finding prompted us to explore the involvement of LAG-3 to specifically identify functionally exhausted T cells. We found that LAG-3 was expressed on a subset of intratumoral T cells from FL and LAG-3+ T cells almost exclusively came from PD-1+ population. CyTOF analysis revealed that intratumoral LAG-3+ T cells were phenotypically heterogeneous as LAG-3 was expressed on a variety of T cell subsets. In contrast to PD-1+LAG-3- cells, intratumoral PD-1+LAG-3+ T cells exhibited reduced capacity to produce cytokines and granules. LAG-3 expression could be substantially upregulated on CD4+ or CD8+ T cells by IL-12, a cytokine that has been shown to induce T-cell exhaustion and be increased in the serum of lymphoma patients. Furthermore, we found that blockade of both PD-1 and LAG-3 signaling enhanced the function of intratumoral CD8+ T cells resulting in increased IFN-γ and IL-2 production. Clinically, LAG-3 expression on intratumoral T cells correlated with a poor outcome in FL patients. Taken together, we find that LAG-3 expression is necessary to identify the population of intratumoral PD-1+ T cells that are functionally exhausted and, in contrast, find that PD-1+LAG-3- T cells are simply activated cells that are immunologically functional. These findings may have important implications for immune checkpoint therapy in FL."

The use of mass cytometry together with a combinatorial multiplex tetramer staining has successfully been applied for probing and characterization of multiple antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in human blood samples. The present study shows that this approach can also be used to rapidly assess the magnitude of influenza-specific CD8+ T cell epitope dominance across lymph nodes and lungs in a murine model of a highly pathological influenza infection. Moreover, we show feasibility of extending this approach to include concurrent identification of virus-specific CD4+ T cells. By using a double coding approach, we probed for five influenza-specific MHCI-peptide complexes as well as one influenza-specific MHCII-peptide complex in the presence of irrelevant control peptides and show that this approach is capable of tracking antigen-specific T cells across individual lymph nodes and lungs. The simultaneous staining with 26 surface maker molecules further facilitated an in-depth characterization of T cells reacting with influenza epitopes and revealed tissue specific phenotypic differences between CD4+ T cells targeting the same pathogenic epitope. In conclusion, this approach provides the possibility for a rapid and comprehensive analysis of antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in different disease settings that might be advantageous for subsequent vaccine formulation strategies."

At the same time, recent studies have highlighted the heterogeneity of the human immune system. Despite this heterogeneity, we do not routinely measure immune competence in clinical practice, and there are no consensus assays of healthy immune function. Using mass cytometry (CyTOF), we can simultaneously detect ∼40 markers to identify various cell subsets and determine their function by the expression of cytokines, cytotoxicity, and activation markers. This can help assess 'immunocompetence' and facilitate better implementation of immunotherapies, both in specific disease settings and perhaps eventually as a prognostic tool in healthy subjects.

Disease phenotypes Löfgren's syndrome (LS) and ""non-LS"" differ in terms of clinical manifestations, genetic background, HLA association, and prognosis, but the underlying inflammatory mechanisms largely remain unknown. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells from four HLA-DRB1*03+ LS and four HLA-DRB1*03- non-LS patients were analyzed by mass cytometry, using a panel of 33 unique markers. Differentially regulated CD4+ T cell populations were identified using the Citrus algorithm, and t-stochastic neighborhood embedding was applied for dimensionality reduction and single-cell data visualization. We identified 19 individual CD4+ T cell clusters differing significantly in abundance between LS and non-LS patients. Seven clusters more frequent in LS patients were characterized by significantly higher expression of regulatory receptors CTLA-4, PD-1, and ICOS, along with low expression of adhesion marker CD44. In contrast, 12 clusters primarily found in non-LS displayed elevated expression of activation and effector markers HLA-DR, CD127, CD39, as well as CD44. Hierarchical clustering further indicated functional heterogeneity and diverse origins of T cell receptor Vα2.3/Vβ22-restricted cells in LS. Finally, a near-complete overlap of CD8 and Ki-67 expression suggested larger influence of CD8+ T cell activity on sarcoid inflammation than previously appreciated. In this study, we provide detailed characterization of pulmonary T cells and immunological parameters that define separate disease pathways in LS and non-LS. With direct association to clinical parameters, such as granuloma persistence, resolution, or chronic inflammation, these results provide a valuable foundation for further exploration and potential clinical application."

Thus, β-cells are currently the prime target for cell-replacement and regenerative therapy. Triggering endogenous repair is a promising strategy to restore β-cell mass and normoglycemia in diabetic patients. Potential strategies include targeting specific β-cell subpopulations to increase proliferation or maturation. Alternatively, transdifferentiation of pancreatic islet cells (e.g. α- or δ-cells), extra-islet cells (acinar and ductal cells), hepatocytes, or intestinal cells into insulin-producing cells might improve glycemic control. To this end, it is crucial to systematically characterize and unravel the transcriptional program of all pancreatic cell types at the molecular level in homeostasis and disease. Furthermore, it is necessary to better determine the underlying mechanisms of β-cell maturation, maintenance, and dysfunction in diabetes, to identify and molecularly profile endocrine subpopulations with regenerative potential, and to translate the findings from mice to man. Recent approaches in single-cell biology started to illuminate heterogeneity and plasticity in the pancreas that might be targeted for β-cell regeneration in diabetic patients."

To achieve a cure, most HIV-infected cells must be identified and eliminated. While obtaining gut biopsies is a relatively noninvasive method of sampling relevant tissue for monitoring HIV activity, immune cell isolation from these limited tissue samples has proven to be challenging. Enzymatic tissue digestion is required for maximal immune cell isolation from gut biopsies. However, these enzymatic digestions can also be detrimental for preservation of cellular surface markers that are required for accurate identification of various subsets of leukocytes. In this study, we describe an optimized protocol for isolation of lymphocytes from human gut biopsies. We also discuss our validation results, which show that compared with several other collagenase preparations, the use of CSLPA maintains high lymphocyte recovery while preserving the integrity of most cellular surface antigens that we tested. Importantly, chemokine receptors that are used to characterize various subsets of T cells, which are notorious for being digested during a typical enzymatic tissue digestion, are highly preserved using this protocol."

Using antibodies to cell surface markers or multidimensional clustering of β-cells using more than 20 protein markers by mass cytometry, 4 distinct groups of β-cells could be differentiated. However, whether these states represent permanent cell lineages or are readily interconvertible from one group to another remains to be determined.

It is, however, challenging to assay a large number (more than 3) of signalling species in live-cell imaging, which makes it difficult to probe single-cell signalling kinetic trajectories in large dimensions. Flow and mass cytometry techniques can measure a large number (4 to more than 40) of signalling species but are unable to track single cells. Thus, cytometry experiments provide detailed time-stamped snapshots of single-cell signalling kinetics. Is it possible to use the time-stamped cytometry data to reconstruct single-cell signalling trajectories? Borrowing concepts of conserved and slow variables from non-equilibrium statistical physics we develop an approach to reconstruct signalling trajectories using snapshot data by creating new variables that remain invariant or vary slowly during the signalling kinetics. We apply this approach to reconstruct trajectories using snapshot data obtained from in silico simulations, live-cell imaging measurements, and, synthetic flow cytometry datasets.

The approach is likely to have implications for solving matching problems in a wide range of disciplines."

Mass cytometry creates a high-dimensional description vector for single cells by time-of-flight measurement. Recently, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding (t-SNE) has emerged as one of the state-of-the-art techniques for the visualization and exploration of single-cell data. Ever increasing amounts of data lead to the adoption of Hierarchical Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding (HSNE), enabling the hierarchical representation of the data. Here, the hierarchy is explored selectively by the analyst, who can request more and more detail in areas of interest. Such hierarchies are usually explored by visualizing disconnected plots of selections in different levels of the hierarchy. This poses problems for navigation, by imposing a high cognitive load on the analyst. In this work, we present an interactive summary-visualization to tackle this problem. CyteGuide guides the analyst through the exploration of hierarchically represented single-cell data, and provides a complete overview of the current state of the analysis. We conducted a two-phase user study with domain experts that use HSNE for data exploration. We first studied their problems with their current workflow using HSNE and the requirements to ease this workflow in a field study. These requirements have been the basis for our visual design. In the second phase, we verified our proposed solution in a user evaluation."

Systems-level analyses offer increased power to sort patients on the basis of coordinated changes across immune cells and proteins. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a well-established form of immunotherapy whereby a donor immune system induces a graft-versus-leukemia response. This fails when the donor immune system regenerates improperly, leaving the patient susceptible to infections and leukemia relapse. We present a systems-level analysis by mass cytometry and serum profiling in 26 patients sampled 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after transplantation. Using a combination of machine learning and topological data analyses, we show that global immune signatures associated with clinical outcome can be revealed, even when patients are few and heterogeneous. This high-resolution systems immune monitoring approach holds the potential for improving the development and evaluation of immunotherapies in the future."

To address these issues, we utilized mass cytometry to comprehensively profile the effects of checkpoint blockade on tumor immune infiltrates in human melanoma and murine tumor models. These analyses reveal a spectrum of tumor-infiltrating T cell populations that are highly similar between tumor models and indicate that checkpoint blockade targets only specific subsets of tumor-infiltrating T cell populations. Anti-PD-1 predominantly induces the expansion of specific tumor-infiltrating exhausted-like CD8 T cell subsets. In contrast, anti-CTLA-4 induces the expansion of an ICOS+ Th1-like CD4 effector population in addition to engaging specific subsets of exhausted-like CD8 T cells. Thus, our findings indicate that anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 checkpoint-blockade-induced immune responses are driven by distinct cellular mechanisms."

Whether these technologies reveal pertinent biology when implemented in interventional clinical trials is an important question. The beneficial effects of preoperative arginine-enriched dietary supplements (AES) are highly context specific, as they reduce infection rates in elective surgery, but possibly increase morbidity in critically ill patients. This study combined single-cell mass cytometry with the multiplex analysis of relevant plasma cytokines to comprehensively profile the immune-modifying effects of this much-debated intervention in patients undergoing surgery. An elastic net algorithm applied to the high-dimensional mass cytometry dataset identified a cross-validated model consisting of 20 interrelated immune features that separated patients assigned to AES from controls. The model revealed wide-ranging effects of AES on innate and adaptive immune compartments. Notably, AES increased STAT1 and STAT3 signaling responses in lymphoid cell subsets after surgery, consistent with enhanced adaptive mechanisms that may protect against postsurgical infection. Unexpectedly, AES also increased ERK and P38 MAPK signaling responses in monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which was paired with their pronounced expansion. These results provide novel mechanistic arguments as to why AES may exert context-specific beneficial or adverse effects in patients with critical illness. This study lays out an analytical framework to distill high-dimensional datasets gathered in an interventional clinical trial into a fairly simple model that converges with known biology and provides insight into novel and clinically relevant cellular mechanisms."

Epub 2017 Jul 31.,Keywords: Adaptive; Cellular immunity; Humoral immunity; Immunity; Immunization; Immunogenetics; Innate immunity; Vaccination; Vaccines.,"At the current time, the field of vaccinology remains empirical in many respects. Vaccine development, vaccine immunogenicity, and vaccine efficacy have, for the most part, historically been driven by an empiric ""isolate-inactivate-inject"" paradigm. In turn, a population-level public health paradigm of ""the same dose for everyone for every disease"" model has been the normative thinking in regard to prevention of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases. In addition, up until recently, no vaccines had been designed specifically to overcome the immunosenescence of aging, consistent with a post-WWII mentality of developing vaccines and vaccine programs for children. It is now recognized that the current lack of knowledge concerning how immune responses to vaccines are generated is a critical barrier to understanding poor vaccine responses in the elderly and in immunoimmaturity, discovery of new correlates of vaccine immunogenicity (vaccine response biomarkers), and a directed approach to new vaccine development. The new fields of vaccinomics and adversomics provide models that permit global profiling of the innate, humoral, and cellular immune responses integrated at a systems biology level. This has advanced the science beyond that of reductionist scientific approaches by revealing novel interactions between and within the immune system and other biological systems (beyond transcriptional level), which are critical to developing ""downstream"" adaptive humoral and cellular responses to infectious pathogens and vaccines. Others have applied systems level approaches to the study of antibody responses (a.k.a. ""systems serology""), [1] high-dimensional cell subset immunophenotyping through CyTOF, [2,3] and vaccine induced metabolic changes [4]. In turn, this knowledge is being utilized to better understand the following: identifying who is at risk for which infections; the level of risk that exists regarding poor immunogenicity and/or serious adverse events; and the type or dose of vaccine needed to fully protect an individual. In toto, such approaches allow for a personalized approach to the practice of vaccinology, analogous to the substantial inroads that individualized medicine is playing in other fields of human health and medicine. Herein we briefly review the field of vaccinomics, adversomics, and personalized vaccinology."

In addition, other metals in the mass range such as silver can be detected per cell. Bacteria are known to be sensible to silver and a protocol was developed to measure both the number of affected cells per population and the quantities of silver per cell. Methods: For mass cytometry ruthenium red was used as a marker for all cells of a population while parallel application of cisplatin discriminated live from dead cells. Silver quantities per cell and frequencies of silver containing cells in a population were measured by mass cytometry. In addition, live/dead subpopulations were analyzed by flow cytometry and distinguished by cell sorting based on ruthenium red and propidium iodide double staining. Verification of the cells' silver load was performed on the bulk level by using ICP-MS in combination with cell sorting. The protocol was developed by conveying both, fast and non-growing Pseudomonas putida cells as test organisms. Results: A workflow for labeling bacteria in order to be analyzed by mass cytometry was developed. Three different parameters were tested: ruthenium red provided counts for all bacterial cells in a population while consecutively applied cisplatin marked the frequency of dead cells. Apparent population heterogeneity was detected by different frequencies of silver containing cells. Silver quantities per cell were also well measurable. Generally, AgNP-10 treatment caused higher frequencies of dead cells, higher frequencies of silver containing cells and higher per-cell silver quantities. Due to an assumed chemical equilibrium of free and bound silver ions live and dead cells were associated with silver in equal quantities and this preferably during exponential growth. With ICP-MS up to 1.5 fg silver per bacterial cell were detected. Conclusion: An effective mass cytometry protocol was developed for the detection and quantification of silver in single bacterial cells of different physiological states. The silver quantities were generally heterogeneously distributed among cells in a population, the degree of which was dependent on micro-environmental conditions and on silver applied either in ion or nanoparticle-aggregated form."

We investigated the relationship between coagulation and the resolution of inflammation and infection by lipid mediators (LMs) through metabololipidomics-based profiling of human whole blood (WB) during coagulation. We identified temporal clusters of endogenously produced prothrombotic and proinflammatory LMs (eicosanoids), as well as specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs). In addition to eicosanoids, a specific SPM cluster was identified that consisted of resolvin E1 (RvE1), RvD1, RvD5, lipoxin B4, and maresin 1, each of which was present at bioactive concentrations (0.1 to 1 nM). Removal of adenosine from the coagulating blood markedly enhanced the amounts of SPMs produced and further increased the biosynthesis of RvD3, RvD4, and RvD6. The cyclooxygenase inhibitors celecoxib and indomethacin, which block the production of thromboxanes and prostanoids, did not block the production of clot-driven SPMs. Unbiased mass cytometry analysis demonstrated that the SPM cluster produced in human blood targeted leukocytes at the single-cell level, directly activating ERK and CREB signaling in neutrophils and CD14+ monocytes. Treatment of human WB with the components of this SPM cluster enhanced both the phagocytosis and killing of Escherichia coli by leukocytes. Together, these data identify a proresolving LM circuit, including endogenous molecular brakes and accelerators, which promoted host defense. These temporal LM-SPM clusters can provide accessible metabolomic profiles for precision and personalized medicine."

Early immune activation is believed to be associated with hemodynamic stresses and thrombus formation as cells traffic through blood vessels. We applied an extracorporeal perfusion system to model these effects ex vivo, and combined this with a phospho-CyTOF workflow to comprehensively evaluate single-cell signatures of early activation across all major circulating immune subsets. These approaches showed immune activation following passage through the perfusion chamber, most notably in monocytes, which exhibited platelet aggregation and significantly elevated expression of multiple phospho-proteins. Overall, these studies outline a robust and broadly applicable workflow to leverage phospho-CyTOF to characterize immune activation in response to ex vivo or in vivo perturbations and may facilitate identification of novel therapeutic targets in SCD and other inflammatory diseases."

Bottom-up proteomics analyses now allow efficient extraction and digestion such that membrane protein coverage is essentially complete, making up around one third of the proteome. However, this coverage relies upon hydrophilic loop regions while transmembrane domains are generally poorly covered in peptide-based strategies. Top-down mass spectrometry where the intact membrane protein is fragmented in the gas phase gives good coverage in transmembrane regions, and membrane fractions are yielding to high-throughput top-down proteomics. Exciting progress in native mass spectrometry of membrane protein complexes is providing insights into subunit stoichiometry and lipid binding, and cross-linking strategies are contributing critical in-vivo information.

However, ~30-40% of patients develop resistance to imatinib therapy. Although most resistance is caused by mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain, 50-85% of these patients develop resistance in the absence of new mutations. In these cases, targeting other pathways may be needed to regain clinical response. Using label-free Raman spectromicroscopy, we evaluated a number of leukemia cell lines and discovered an aberrant accumulation of cholesteryl ester (CE) in CML, which was found to be a result of BCR-ABL kinase activity. CE accumulation in CML was found to be a cancer-specific phenomenon as untransformed cells did not accumulate CE. Blocking cholesterol esterification with avasimibe, a potent inhibitor of acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT-1), significantly suppressed CML cell proliferation in Ba/F3 cells with the BCR-ABLT315I mutation and in K562 cells rendered imatinib resistant without mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain (K562R cells). Furthermore, the combination of avasimibe and imatinib caused a profound synergistic inhibition of cell proliferation in K562R cells, but not in Ba/F3T315I. This synergistic effect was confirmed in a K562R xenograft mouse model. Analysis of primary cells from a BCR-ABL mutation-independent imatinib resistant patient by mass cytometry suggested that the synergy may be due to downregulation of the MAPK pathway by avasimibe, which sensitized the CML cells to imatinib treatment. Collectively, these data demonstrate a novel strategy for overcoming BCR-ABL mutation-independent TKI resistance in CML."

This has led to resurgence in attempts to develop new therapeutic strategies/targets against tuberculosis (TB). We show that Mtb down-regulates sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent deacetylase, in monocytes/macrophages, TB animal models, and TB patients with active disease. Activation of SIRT1 reduced intracellular growth of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant strains of Mtb and induced phagosome-lysosome fusion and autophagy in a SIRT1-dependent manner. SIRT1 activation dampened Mtb-mediated persistent inflammatory responses via deacetylation of RelA/p65, leading to impaired binding of RelA/p65 on the promoter of inflammatory genes. In Mtb-infected mice, the use of SIRT1 activators ameliorated lung pathology, reduced chronic inflammation, and enhanced efficacy of anti-TB drug. Mass cytometry-based high-dimensional analysis revealed that SIRT1 activation mediated modulation of lung myeloid cells in Mtb-infected mice. Myeloid cell-specific SIRT1 knockout mice display increased inflammatory responses and susceptibility to Mtb infection. Collectively, these results provide a link between SIRT1 activation and TB pathogenesis and indicate a potential of SIRT1 activators in designing an effective and clinically relevant host-directed therapies for TB."

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry is a well-established method to resolve cell-associated (metal) NPs in bulk cell populations, however, such analysis at single cell level remains a challenge. Here we used mass cytometry, a technique that combines single cell analysis and time-of-flight mass spectrometry, to quantitatively analyze extra- and intracellular silver (Ag) in individual Ag NP exposed human T-lymphocytes. The results revealed significant population heterogeneity: for example, in lymphocytes exposed to 3 μg of 30 nm branched polyethylene imine coated Ag NPs/mL the extracellularly bound Ag varied from 79 to 560 fg and cellular uptake from 17 to 121 fg. Similar amplitude of heterogeneity was observed in cells exposed to various doses of Ag NPs with other sizes and surface coatings, demonstrating the importance of single cell analysis when studying NP-cell interactions. Although mass cytometry has some shortcomings such as inability to analyze potential transformation or dissolution of NPs in cells, we consider this method as the most promising for quantitative assessment of cell-NP interaction at single cell level."

In particular, high circulating monocyte or myeloid-derived suppressor cell counts are associated with poor prognosis for patients with high-grade B-cell lymphomas. Macrophages with an M2 phenotype are enriched within lymphoma tumors. However, the M1/M2 nomenclature is now deprecated and the clinical impact of this phenotype remains controversial. Across cancer types, myeloid cells are primarily thought to function as immune suppressors during tumor initiation and maintenance, but the biological mechanisms behind the myeloid signatures are still poorly understood in germinal center B-cell lymphomas. Herein, we describe the role and clinical relevance of myeloid cells in B-cell lymphoma and propose innovative approaches to decipher this complex cellular compartment. Indeed, characterization of this heterogeneous cell ecosystem has been largely accomplished with ""low-resolution"" approaches like morphological evaluation and immunohistochemistry, where cells are characterized using a few proteins and qualitative metrics. High-resolution, quantitative approaches, such as mass cytometry, are valuable to better understand myeloid cell diversity, functions, and to identify potential targets for novel therapies."

NKG2D ligands are generally not expressed on the cell surface of normal, non-stressed cells, but expression of MICA and MICB in CD intestine has been reported. In this exploratory study, we further characterize the expression of NKG2D and its ligands, including the less well-described ULBP4-6, in CD, and test if NKG2D ligand interactions are involved in the migration of activated T cells into the affected mucosal compartments. Intestinal tissue from CD patients and healthy controls were analyzed by flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and immunohistochemistry for expression of NKG2D and ligands, and for cytokine release. Furthermore, NKG2D-dependent chemotaxis of activated CD8+ T cells across a monolayer of ligand-expressing human intestinal endothelial cells was examined. Activated lymphocytes down-regulated NKG2D expression upon accumulation in inflamed CD intestine. NKG2D expression on CD56+ T and γδ T cells from inflamed tissue seemed inversely correlated with CRP levels and cytokine release. B cells, monocytes, mucosal epithelium, and vascular endothelium expressed NKG2D ligands in inflamed CD intestine. The expression of NKG2D ligands was correlated with cytokine release, but was highly variable between patients. Stimulation of vascular intestinal endothelial cells in vitro induced expression of NKG2D ligands, including MICA/B and ULBP2/6. Blockade of NKG2D on CD8+ T cells inhibited the migration over ligand-expressing endothelial cells. Intestinal induction of NKG2D ligands and ligand-induced down-regulation of NKG2D in CD suggest that the NKG2D-ligand interaction may be involved in both the activation and recruitment of NKG2D+ lymphocytes into the inflamed CD intestine."

Of the 4 DENV serotypes, epidemiological data suggest that DENV-2 secondary infections are associated with more severe disease than DENV-4 infections. Mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) was used to dissect immune changes induced by DENV-2 and DENV-4 in human DCs, the initial targets of primary infections that likely affect infection outcomes. Strikingly, DENV-4 replication peaked earlier and promoted stronger innate immune responses, with increased expression of DC activation and migration markers and increased cytokine production, compared with DENV-2. In addition, infected DCs produced higher levels of inflammatory cytokines compared with bystander DCs, which mainly produced IFN-induced cytokines. These high-dimensional analyses during DENV-2 and DENV-4 infections revealed distinct viral signatures marked by different replication strategies and antiviral innate immune induction in DCs, which may result in different viral fitness, transmission, and pathogenesis."

Click chemistry reactions have become popular in the past decade, as they can resolve these issues. This protocol introduces a novel assay able to bridge flow cytometry and CyTOF analysis for active S-phase determination in cell cycle applications, combining well-established click chemistry with a novel iodo-deoxyuridine (IdU) azide derivative and a cross-reactive anti-IdU antibody for detecting incorporated EdU during DNA synthesis.

Even though treatment of severe cGVHD has improved during recent years, it remains one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in affected patients. Biomarkers in blood that could aid in the diagnosis and classification of cGVHD severity are needed for the development of novel treatment strategies that can alleviate symptoms and reduce the need for painful and sometimes complicated tissue biopsies. Methods that comprehensively profile complex biological systems such as the immune system can reveal unanticipated markers when used with the appropriate methods of data analysis. Here, we used mass cytometry, flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and multiplex assays to systematically profile immune cell populations in 68 patients with varying grades of cGVHD. We identified multiple subpopulations across T, B, and NK-cell lineages that distinguished patients with cGVHD from those without cGVHD and which were associated in varying ways with severity of cGVHD. Specifically, initial flow cytometry demonstrated that patients with more severe cGVHD had lower mucosal-associated T cell frequencies, with a concomitant higher level of CD38 expression on T cells. Mass cytometry could identify unique subpopulations specific for cGVHD severity albeit with some seemingly conflicting results. For instance, patients with severe cGVHD had an increased frequency of activated B cells compared to patients with moderate cGVHD while activated B cells were found at a reduced frequency in patients with mild cGVHD compared to patients without cGVHD. Moreover, results indicate it may be possible to validate mass cytometry results with clinically viable, smaller flow cytometry panels. Finally, no differences in levels of blood soluble markers could be identified, with the exception for the semi-soluble combined marker B-cell activating factor/B cell ratio, which was increased in patients with mild cGVHD compared to patients without cGVHD. These findings suggest that interdependencies between such perturbed subpopulations of cells play a role in cGVHD pathogenesis and can serve as future diagnostic and therapeutic targets."

Here, we interrogated these compartments in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using high-dimensional proteomic and transcriptomic analyses. By time-of-flight mass cytometry, we found that the TME was enriched in regulatory T cells (Tregs), tissue resident memory CD8+ T cells (TRMs), resident natural killer cells (NKRs), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). This finding was also validated with immunofluorescence staining on Foxp3+CD4+ and PD-1+CD8+ T cells. Interestingly, Tregs and TRMs isolated from the TME expressed multiple markers for T-cell exhaustion, including PD-1, Lag-3, and Tim-3 compared with Tregs and TRMs isolated from the NTME. We found PD-1+ TRMs were the predominant T-cell subset responsive to anti-PD-1 treatment and significantly reduced in number with increasing HCC tumor progression. Furthermore, T-bet was identified as a key transcription factor, negatively correlated with PD-1 expression on memory CD8+ T cells, and the PD-1:T-bet ratio increased upon exposure to tumor antigens. Finally, transcriptomic analysis of tumor and adjacent nontumor tissues identified a chemotactic gradient for recruitment of TAMs and NKRs via CXCR3/CXCL10 and CCR6/CCL20 pathways, respectively. Taken together, these data confirm the existence of an immunosuppressive gradient across the TME, NTME, and peripheral blood in primary HCC that manipulates the activation status of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes and renders them immunocompromised against tumor cells. By understanding the immunologic composition of this gradient, more effective immunotherapeutics for HCC may be designed."

Lacrimal glands of female BALB/c mice were experimentally injured by intra-glandular injection of interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1α). The lacrimal glands were harvested at various time points following injury (1 to 14 days) and used to either prepare single cell suspensions for CyTOF immuno-phenotyping analyses or to extract RNA for gene expression studies using RNA-Seq. CyTOF immuno-phenotyping identified monocytes and neutrophils as the major infiltrating populations 1 and 2 days post injury. Clustering of significantly differentially expressed genes identified 13 distinct molecular signatures: 3 associated with immune/inflammatory processes included genes up-regulated at days 1-2 and 3 associated with reparative processes with genes up-regulated primarily between days 4 and 5. Finally, clustering identified 65 genes which were specifically up-regulated 2 days post injury which was enriched for muscle specific genes. The expression of select muscle-related proteins was confirmed by immunohistochemistry which identified a subset of cells expressing these proteins. Double staining experiments showed that these cells are distinct from the myoepithelial cells. We conclude that experimentally induced injury to the lacrimal gland leads to massive infiltration by neutrophils and monocytes which resolved after 3 days. RNAseq and immunohistochemistry identified a group of cells, other than myoepithelial cells, that express muscle-related proteins that could play an important role in lacrimal gland repair."

We investigated the interplay between the signaling pathways stimulated by the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the activating receptor NKG2D in immature (CD56bright) and mature (CD56dim) subsets of human primary NK cells using mass cytometry experiments and in silico modeling. Our analysis revealed that IL-2 changed the abundances of several key proteins, including NKG2D and the phosphatase CD45. Furthermore, we found differences in correlations between protein abundances, which were associated with the maturation state of the NK cells. The mass cytometry measurements also revealed that the signaling kinetics of key protein abundances induced by NKG2D stimulation depended on the maturation state and the pretreatment condition of the NK cells. Our in silico model, which described the multidimensional data with coupled first-order reactions, predicted that the increase in CD45 abundance was a major enhancer of NKG2D-mediated activation in IL-2-treated CD56bright NK cells but not in IL-2-treated CD56dim NK cells. This dependence on CD45 was verified by measurement of CD107a mobilization to the NK cell surface (a marker of activation). Our mathematical framework can be used to glean mechanisms underlying synergistic signaling pathways in other activated immune cells."

First, we compared different fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies specific for CD4, such as FITC, Vio667, VioGreen or VioBlue for their compatibility with the conventional secondary MAXPAR® labelling protocol. After labelling with 141 Pr, the fluorescence emission spectra of all fluorochromes investigated retained their characteristics, and CD4 dual conjugates (DCs) provided consistent results in immune phenotyping assays performed by FC and MC. The phenotypical composition of CD4+ T-cells was maintained after enrichment by FC sorting using different CD4 DCs. Finally, magnetic cell depletion was combined with FC sorting using CD19-VioBlue-142 Nd, CD20-VioGreen-147 Sm, CD27-Cy5-167 Er and CD38-Alexa488-143 Nd DC to enrich rare human plasmablasts to purities >80%, which allowed a subsequent deep phenotyping by MC.

However, glial tumors including those seen in children carry fewer mutations and there is an unmet need to identify new antigenic targets of anti-tumor immunity. SOX2 is an embryonal stem cell antigen implicated in the biology of glioma initiating cells. Expression of SOX2 by pediatric glial tumors and the capacity of the immune system in these patients to recognize SOX2 has not been previously studied. We examined the expression of SOX2 on archived paraffin-embedded tissue from pediatric glial tumors. The presence of T-cell immunity to SOX2 was examined in both blood and tumor-infiltrating T-cells in children and young adults with glioma. The nature of tumor-infiltrating immune cells was analyzed with a 37-marker panel using single-cell mass cytometry. SOX2 is expressed by tumor cells but not surrounding normal tissue in pediatric gliomas of all grades. T-cells against this antigen can be detected in blood and tumor tissue in glioma patients. Glial tumors are enriched for CD8/CD4 T-cells with tissue resident memory (TRM; CD45RO+, CD69+, CCR7-) phenotype, which co-express multiple inhibitory checkpoints including PD-1, PD-L1 and TIGIT. Tumors also contain natural killer cells with reduced expression of lytic granzyme. Our data demonstrate immunogenicity of SOX2, which is specifically overexpressed on pediatric glial tumor cells. Harnessing tumor immunity in glioma will likely require the combined targeting of multiple inhibitory checkpoints."

However, the clinical significance of such observations remained to be assessed on a larger cohort of patients. NK maturation based on expression of CD56, CD57, and KIR was assessed by flow cytometry in newly diagnosed AML patients (N = 87 patients from GOELAMS-LAM-IR-2006 multicenter trial).

Unsupervised integrated analysis of NK maturation markers confirmed the existence of three distinct groups of patients [hypomaturation (24.1%), intermediate maturation (66.7%), and hypermaturation (9.2%)]. In univariate analysis, significant differences in overall survival (OS) (P = 0.0006) and relapse-free survival (RFS) (P < 0.0001) were observed among these different groups.

Consistently, patients with hypomaturation profile had reduced RFS, with 3-year RFS rates of 0 vs 52.6 and 73.3% for patients with intermediate and hypermaturation, respectively. In multivariate Cox regression models, NK hypomaturation remained significantly associated with reduced OS and RFS, independent of other factors [hazard ratio (HR) = 4.15, P = 0.004 and HR = 8.23, P = 0.003, respectively]. NK maturation defects were further explored by mass cytometry and revealed that NK hypomaturation profile is associated with a reduced frequency of memory-like NK cells. In conclusion, besides classical alterations of NK triggering and inhibitory receptors expression in AML, we confirm that the homeostasis of NK maturation can be modified in the context of AML, notably with a deep maturation blockade in almost 10% patients."

Epub 2017 Jun 8.,Keywords: Beta cells; Cellular heterogeneity; Diabetes; Islets of Langerhans; Pancreas; Review; Single-cell proteomics; Single-cell transcriptomics; Transcriptional plasticity.,"Beta cells are primarily defined by their ability to produce insulin and secrete it in response to appropriate stimuli. It has been known for some time, however, that beta cells are not functionally identical to each other and that the rates of insulin synthesis and release differ from cell to cell, although the functional significance of this variability remains unclear. Recent studies have used heterogeneous gene expression to isolate and evaluate different subpopulations of beta cells and to demonstrate alterations in these subpopulations in diabetes. In the last few years, novel technologies have emerged that permit the detailed evaluation of the proteome (e.g. time-of-flight mass spectroscopy, [CyTOF]) and transcriptome (e.g. massively parallel RNA sequencing) at the single-cell level, and tools for single beta cell metabolomics and epigenomics are quickly maturing. The first wave of single beta cell proteome and transcriptome studies were published in 2016, giving a glimpse into the power, but also the limitations, of these approaches. Despite this progress, it remains unclear if the observed heterogeneity of beta cells represents stable, distinct beta cell types or, alternatively, highly dynamic beta cell states. Here we provide a concise overview of recent developments in the emerging field of beta cell heterogeneity and the implications for our understanding of beta cell biology and pathology."

Epub 2017 Jun 1.,Keywords: BRAF inhibitor; RNA-binding protein HuR; cell heterogeneity; melanoma; single-cell mass cytometry; targeted therapy.,"Tumor plasticity and the heterogeneous response of melanoma cells to targeted therapies are major limits for the long-term efficacy of this line of therapy. Targeting tumor plasticity is theoretically possible through the modulation of the expression of RNA-binding proteins which can affect many different compensatory mechanisms of the adaptive response of malignant cells to targeted therapies. Human antigen R (HuR) is a modulator of gene expression and a transacting factor in the mRNA-processing machinery used in the cell stress response, and is a potential target for reducing tumor plasticity. In this experiment, we exploit the inherent heterogeneous response of the A375 melanoma line to suboptimal BRAF inhibition as a model of immediate adaptive response. We first observe that HuR overexpression can prevent the heterogeneous response and thus the immediate paradoxical proliferation induced by low-doses vemurafenib treatment. We then use single-cell mass cytometry to characterize subpopulations, including those that paradoxically proliferate, based on their proliferation rate and the expression patterns of markers involved in the reversible adaptive resistance to BRAF inhibition and/or recognized as HuR targets involved in cell cycle regulation. Under suboptimal BRAF inhibition, HuR overexpression affects these subpopulations and their expression pattern with contrasting responses depending on their proliferation rate: faster-proliferating vemurafenib-sensitive or -resistant subpopulations showed higher death tendency and reduced size, and slower-proliferating subpopulations showed an attenuated resistant expression response and their paradoxical proliferation was inhibited. These observations pave the way to new therapeutic strategies for preventing the heterogeneous response of tumors to targeted therapies."

In both cases, biomarkers predicting drug response would be very useful to guide clinicians in their choice. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the value of lymphocyte phenotyping as a marker of therapeutic response. Of the 1063 articles retrieved, 39 fulfilled inclusion criteria and were included in the present review (25 for RA, 10 for SLE, and 4 for pSS). Lymphocyte phenotyping was described as a biomarker of therapeutic response in many studies, but most results could not be confirmed by independent teams using multivariate analysis. The most consistent result might be the association between rituximab response and the levels of memory B cells before therapy, although some studies were controversial. Thus, lymphocyte phenotyping cannot yet be proposed as a biomarker of response in rheumatic autoimmune diseases. The lack of reproducibility between studies may be explained by technical issues influencing lymphocyte phenotyping so standardization procedures should be developed for future studies. The patients' characteristics vary between studies, and large population studies, including a wide range of patients' characteristics and biomarkers, are required to provide predictive models for clinical outcomes. The use of new flow cytometry techniques such as single-cell mass cytometry technology might also help finder reliable biomarkers in the future."

Here, we present an updated R-based pipeline for differential analyses of HDCyto data, largely based on Bioconductor packages. We computationally define cell populations using FlowSOM clustering, and facilitate an optional but reproducible strategy for manual merging of algorithm-generated clusters. Our workflow offers different analysis paths, including association of cell type abundance with a phenotype or changes in signalling markers within specific subpopulations, or differential analyses of aggregated signals. Importantly, the differential analyses we show are based on regression frameworks where the HDCyto data is the response; thus, we are able to model arbitrary experimental designs, such as those with batch effects, paired designs and so on. In particular, we apply generalized linear mixed models or linear mixed models to analyses of cell population abundance or cell-population-specific analyses of signaling markers, allowing overdispersion in cell count or aggregated signals across samples to be appropriately modeled. To support the formal statistical analyses, we encourage exploratory data analysis at every step, including quality control (e.g., multi-dimensional scaling plots), reporting of clustering results (dimensionality reduction, heatmaps with dendrograms) and differential analyses (e.g., plots of aggregated signals)."

However, isolation of CSC from tumor tissue and their characterization are challenging due to uncertainty about their molecular markers and conditions for their propagation. Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), which arises predominantly in the salivary glands, is a slow-growing but relentless tumor that frequently invades nerves and metastasizes. New effective treatment approaches for ACC have not emerged over the last 40years. Previously, based on a highly conserved SOX10 gene signature that we identified in the majority of ACC tumors, we suggested the existence in ACC of SOX10+ cells with neural stem properties and corroborated this hypothesis via isolation from ACC tissue a novel population of CSC, termed ACC-CSC. These cells activated NOTCH1 signaling and co-expressed SOX10 and other ACC-intrinsic neural crest stem cell markers with CD133, a CSC cell surface marker, suggesting that ACC is driven by a previously uncharacterized population of SOX10+/CD133+ cells with neural stem cell properties. Here, we authenticated ACC identity of our primary cultures by demonstrating that most of them harbor MYB-NFIB fusions, which are found in 86% of ACC. We demonstrated using CyTOF, a novel mass cytometry technology, that these cells express high β-catenin and STAT3 levels and are marked by CD24 and CD44. Finally, to streamline development of ACC cell lines, we developed RT-PCR tests for distinguishing mouse and human cells and used immunomagnetic cell sorting to eliminate mouse cells from long-term cell cultures. Overall, this study describes a new population of CSC that activates signaling pathways associated with poor prognosis, validates their ACC identity, and optimizes approaches that can be used for purification of ACC-CSC and generation of cell lines."

A combination of CyTOF mass cytometry and multi-parameter flow cytometry was used to explore the reconstitution kinetics of immune cell subsets in the periphery post-haematopoietic cell transplant (HSCT) and the impact of treatment on the phenotype of circulating T cells in this study population. Repopulation of immune cell subsets progressed similarly for all patients studied 2 years post-therapy, regardless of clinical outcome. At month 2, monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells were proportionally more abundant, while CD4 T cells and B cells were reduced, relative to baseline. In contrast to the changes observed at earlier time-points in the T cell compartment, B cells were proportionally more abundant and expansion in the proportion of naive B cells was observed 1 and 2 years post-therapy. Within the T cell compartment, the proportion of effector memory and late effector subsets of CD4 and CD8 T cells was increased, together with transient increases in proportions of CD45RA-regulatory T cells (Tregs ) and T helper type 1 (Th1 cells) and a decrease in Th17·1 cells.

Given that CD44 variant isoform 9 (CD44v9) is expressed within Spasmolytic Polypeptide/TFF2-Expressing Metaplasia (SPEM) glands during repair, CD44v9 may be play a funcitonal role during the process of regeneration of the gastric epithelium. Here we hypothesize that CD44v9 marks a regenerative cell lineage responsive to infiltrating macrophages during regeneration of the gastric epithelium. Ulcers were induced in CD44-deficient (CD44KO) and C57BL/6 (BL6) mice by a localized application of acetic acid to the serosal surface of the stomach. Gastric organoids expressing CD44v9 were derived from mouse stomachs and transplanted at the ulcer site of CD44KO mice. Ulcers, CD44v9 expression, proliferation and histology were measured 1, 3, 5 and 7-days post-injury. Human-derived gastric organoids were generated from stomach tissue collected from elderly (>55 years) or young (14-20 years) patients. Organoids were transplanted into the stomachs of NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice at the site of injury. Gastric injury was induced in NRG-SGM3 (NRGS) mice harboring human-derived immune cells (hnNRGS) and the immune profile anlayzed by CyTOF. CD44v9 expression emerged within regenerating glands the ulcer margin in response to injury. While ulcers in BL6 mice healed within 7-days post-injury, CD44KO mice exhibited loss of repair and epithelial regeneration. Ulcer healing was promoted in CD44KO mice by transplanted CD55v9-expressing gastric organoids. NSG mice exhibited loss of CD44v9 expression and gastric repair. Transplantation of human-derived gastric organoids from young, but not aged stomachs promoted repair in NSG mouse stomachs in response to injury. Finally, compared to NRGS mice, huNRGS animals exhibited reduced ulcer sizes, an infiltration of human CD162+ macrophages and an emergence of CD44v9 expression in SPEM. Thus, during repair of the gastic epithelium CD44v9 emerges within a regenerative cell lineage that coincides with macrophage inflitration within the injured mucosa.

In primary Sjögren's syndrome, transitional and active naive B cells are increased and memory B cells are decreased compared to healthy controls and other systemic diseases. However, their utility to improve the accuracy of classification criteria has not been proven. In early untreated rheumatoid arthritis, proportions of regulatory T cells are constantly reduced, but other patterns are difficult to determine given the heterogeneity of published studies. In systemic lupus erythematosus, the lack of studies using large cohorts of patients and the diversity of the possible pathological mechanisms involved are also important impediments. Nevertheless, transitional B cell and plasma cell proportions are increased in most of the studies, the CD4/CD8 ratio is decreased, and the number of NK cells is reduced. Despite the low number of studies, anomalies of lymphocyte subset distribution was also described in ANCA-associated vasculitis, systemic scleroderma, and myositis. For now, flow cytometric analysis of lymphocyte subsets has focused mainly on specific subpopulations and is more useful for basic and translational research than for diagnostics in clinical practice. However, new modern methods such as mass cytometry and bioinformatics analyses may offer the possibility to simultaneously account for the relative proportions of multiple lymphocyte subsets and define a global profile in homogeneous groups of patients. The years to come will certainly incorporate such global lymphocyte profiling in reclassification of systemic autoimmune diseases."

The host-parasite interactions of this stage of the infection are responsible for the clinical manifestations of the disease that range from a mild febrile illness to severe and frequently fatal syndromes such as cerebral malaria and multi-organ failure. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of malaria, is particularly predisposed to modulating endothelial function through either direct adhesion to endothelial receptor molecules, or by releasing potent host and parasite products that can stimulate endothelial activation and/or disrupt barrier function.

However, direct comparisons of the two species are rare and were never performed using mass cytometry. Here, whole-blood-derived leukocytes from healthy humans and cynomolgus macaques were analyzed with mass cytometry. Two similar panels of around 30 monoclonal antibodies targeting human markers associated with innate myeloid cells to stain fixed human and macaque leukocytes were constructed. To compare the circulating innate cells from the two primate species, an analysis pipeline combining a clustering analysis by the Spanning-tree Progression Analysis of Density-normalized Events (SPADE) algorithm with a two-step hierarchical clustering of cells nodes and markers was used. Identical SPADE settings were applied to both datasets, except for the 20 clustering markers which slightly differed. A correlation analysis designed to compare the phenotypes of human and macaque cell nodes and based on 16 markers, including 15 shared clustering markers and CD19 for humans or CD20 for macaques, revealed similarities and differences between staining patterns.

Our laboratory has developed an NK cell expansion protocol that generates large quantities of NK cells for therapeutic infusion that secret 20 times the amount of interferon gamma (IFNγ) than resting NK cells. IFNγ can upregulate major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-class I, an inhibitory ligand for NK cells, but can also upregulate intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) which promotes NK:target cell interaction for an efficient lysis. Due to the opposing effects reported for IFNγ on tumor sensitivity to NK cells, we evaluated a panel 22 tumor cell lines from the pediatric preclinical testing program corresponding to different tumor types. We determined the impact of IFNγ on their expression of NK cell activating and inhibitory ligands, death receptors, and adhesion molecules using mass cytometry. We also evaluated the effect of IFNγ on their sensitivity to NK cell-mediated lysis. Our results show upregulation of PD-L1, ICAM-1, MHC-class I, HLA-DR, CD95/FasR, and CD270/HVEM after IFNγ treatment, this upregulation is variable across different tumor types. We also observed a variable impact of IFNγ in NK cell-mediated lysis. For six of the cancer cell lines IFNγ resulted in increased resistance to NK cells, while for three of them it resulted in increased sensitivity. Modeling of the data suggests that the effect of IFNγ on NK cell-mediated tumor lysis is mostly dependent on changes in MHC-class I and ICAM-1 expression. For three of the cell lines with increased resistance, we observed higher upregulation of MHC-class I than ICAM-1. For the cell lines with increased sensitivity after IFNγ treatment, we observed upregulation of ICAM-1 exceeding MHC-class I upregulation. ICAM-1 upregulation resulted in increased conjugate formation between the NK cells and tumor cells, which can contribute to the increased sensitivity observed. However, the effects of MHC-class I and ICAM-1 are not readily predictable. Due to the high IFNγ secretion of NK cell infusion products, a better understanding of the NK ligands on tumor cells and how they are affected by IFNγ is essential to optimize NK cell immunotherapy."

They represent a number of different diseases that are characterized by the development of severe organ fibrosis without any obvious cause, such as the devastating diseases idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and scleroderma. These diseases have a poor prognosis comparable with endstage cancer and are uncurable. Given the phenotypic differences, it was assumed that the different fibrotic diseases also have different pathomechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that many endstage fibrotic diseases, including IPF; scleroderma; myelofibrosis; kidney-, pancreas-, and heart-fibrosis; and nonalcoholic steatohepatosis converge in the activation of the AP1 transcription factor c-JUN in the pathologic fibroblasts. Expression of the related AP1 transcription factor FRA2 was restricted to pulmonary artery hypertension. Induction of c-Jun in mice was sufficient to induce severe fibrosis in multiple organs and steatohepatosis, which was dependent on sustained c-Jun expression. Single cell mass cytometry revealed that c-Jun activates multiple signaling pathways in mice, including pAkt and CD47, which were also induced in human disease. αCD47 antibody treatment and VEGF or PI3K inhibition reversed various organ c-Jun-mediated fibroses in vivo. These data suggest that c-JUN is a central molecular mediator of most fibrotic conditions."

The subsequent challenge of examining, visualizing, and presenting mass cytometry data has motivated continuous development of dimensionality reduction methods. As a result, an increasing recognition of the inherent diversity and complexity of cellular networks is emerging, with the discovery of unexpected cell subpopulations, hierarchies, and developmental pathways, such as those existing within the immune system.

There is a consensual view in favor of standardizing practices currently used to measure programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression that relates to innate resistance. The tumor mutation landscape has been widely explored as a potential predictor of treatment efficacy. In contrast, our knowledge is rather limited as concerns the mechanisms sustaining acquired resistance to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy in patients under treatment. Upregulation of T cell immunoglobulin mucin domain 3 (TIM-3) in CD8+ T-cells has been reported in patients developing acquired resistance to anti-PD-1 treatment. Resistance mechanisms are even more complex for combinatorial strategies linking immunotherapeutic agents and conventional therapies, an area that is expanding rapidly. However, with the arrival of advanced analytical methods such as mass cytometry, there is reason for optimism. These methods can identify cellular mechanisms governing response to therapy and resistance. The clinical use of inhibitors of tumor-microenvironment-modulated pathways, such as those targeting indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO), hold promise for resistance management.

The precision of time-of-flight mass spectrometry combined with the labeling of specific ligands with mass tags enables detection and quantification of more than 40 markers at a single-cell resolution. The 135 available detection channels allow simultaneous study of additional characteristics of complex biological systems across millions of cells. Cutting-edge mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) can profoundly affect our knowledge of cell population heterogeneity and hierarchy, cellular state, multiplexed signaling pathways, proteolysis products, and mRNA transcripts. Although CyTOF is currently scarcely used within the field of investigative dermatology, we aim to highlight CyTOF's utility and demystify the technique. CyTOF may, for example, uncover the immunological heterogeneity and differentiation of Langerhans cells, delineate the signaling pathways responsible for each phase of the hair cycle, or elucidate which proteolysis products from keratinocytes promote skin inflammation. However, the success of mass cytometry experiments depends on fully understanding the methods and how to control for variations when making comparisons between samples. Here, we review key experimental methods for CyTOF that enable accurate data acquisition by optimizing signal detection and minimizing background noise and sample-to-sample variation."

Cells process information about their environment through complex signaling networks composed of many discrete signaling molecules. Individual pathways within these networks are often tightly integrated and highly dynamic, allowing cells to respond to a given stimulus (or, as is typically the case under physiological conditions, a combination of stimuli) in a specific and appropriate manner. However, due to the size and complexity of many cellular signaling networks, it is often difficult to predict how cellular signaling networks will respond under a particular set of conditions. Indeed, crosstalk between individual signaling pathways may lead to responses that are nonintuitive (or even counterintuitive) based on examination of the individual pathways in isolation. Therefore, to gain a more comprehensive view of cell signaling processes, it is important to understand how signaling networks behave at the systems level. This requires integrated strategies that combine quantitative experimental data with computational models. In this chapter, we first examine some of the progress that has recently been made toward understanding the systems-level regulation of cellular signaling networks, with a particular emphasis on phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks. We then discuss how genetically targetable fluorescent biosensors are being used together with computational models to gain unique insights into the spatiotemporal regulation of signaling networks within single, living cells."

Epub 2017 Mar 19.,Keywords: Cytotoxic; Granzymes and perforin; Mass cytometry; NK cell; T cell; T cell differentiation.,"The elimination of infected or tumor cells by direct lysis is a key T and NK cell effector function. T and NK cells can kill target cells by coordinated secretion of cytotoxic granules containing one or both pore-forming proteins, perforin and granulysin and combinations of granzyme (Gzm) family effector proteases (in humans: Gzm A, B, K, M and H). Understanding the pattern of expression of cytotoxic molecules and the relationship to different states of T and NK cells may have direct relevance for immune responses in autoimmunity, infectious disease and cancer. Approaches capable of simultaneously evaluating expression of multiple cytotoxic molecules with detailed information on T and NK differentiation state, however, remain limited. Here, we established a high dimensional mass cytometry approach to comprehensively interrogate single cell proteomic expression of cytotoxic programs and lymphocyte differentiation. This assay identified a coordinated expression pattern of cytotoxic molecules linked to CD8 T cell differentiation stages. Coordinated high expression of perforin, granulysin, Gzm A, Gzm B and Gzm M was associated with markers of late effector memory differentiation and expression of chemokine receptor CX3CR1. However, classical gating and dimensionality reduction approaches also identified other discordant patterns of cytotoxic molecule expression in CD8 T cells, including reduced perforin, but high Gzm A, Gzm K and Gzm M expression. When applied to non-CD8 T cells, this assay identified different patterns of cytotoxic molecule co-expression by CD56hi versus CD56dim defined NK cell developmental stages; in CD4 T cells, low expression of cytotoxic molecules was found mainly in TH1 phenotype cells, but not in Tregs or T follicular helper cells (TFH). Thus, this comprehensive, single cell, proteomic assessment of cytotoxic protein co-expression patterns demonstrates specialized cytotoxic programs in T cells and NK cells linked to their differentiation stages. Such comprehensive cytotoxic profiling may identify distinct patterns of cytotoxic potential relevant for specific infections, autoimmunity or tumor settings."

We observed overexpression of β-catenin in BC-CML stem/progenitor cells, particularly in granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, and highest among a novel CD34+CD38+CD123hiTim-3hi subset as determined by CyTOF analysis. Co-culture with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) induced the expression of β-catenin and its target CD44 in CML cells. A novel Wnt/β-catenin signaling modulator, C82, and nilotinib synergistically killed KBM5T315I and TKI-resistant primary BC-CML cells with or without BCR-ABL kinase mutations even under leukemia/MSC co-culture conditions. Silencing of β-catenin by short interfering RNA restored sensitivity of primary BCR-ABLT315I/E255V BC-CML cells to nilotinib. Combining the C82 pro-drug, PRI-724, with nilotinib significantly prolonged the survival of NOD/SCID/IL2Rγ null mice injected with primary BCR-ABLT315I/E255V BC-CML cells. The combined treatment selectively targeted CML progenitors and inhibited CD44, c-Myc, survivin, p-CRKL and p-STAT5 expression. In addition, pretreating primary BC-CML cells with C82, or the combination, but not with nilotinib alone, significantly impaired their engraftment potential in NOD/SCID/IL2Rγ-null-3/GM/SF mice and significantly prolonged survival. Our data suggest potential benefit of concomitant β-catenin and Bcr-Abl inhibition to prevent or overcome Bcr-Abl kinase-dependent or -independent TKI resistance in BC-CML."

Epub 2017 Feb 24.,Keywords: SPADE; deterministic.,"SPADE stands for spanning-tree progression analysis for density-normalized events. It combines downsampling, clustering and a minimum-spanning tree to provide an intuitive visualization of high-dimensional single-cell data, which assists with the interpretation of the cellular heterogeneity underlying the data. SPADE has been widely used for analysis of high-content flow cytometry data and CyTOF data. The downsampling and clustering components of SPADE are both stochastic, which lead to stochasticity in the tree visualization it generates. Running SPADE twice on the same data may generate two different tree structures. Although they typically lead to the same biological interpretation of subpopulations present in the data, robustness of the algorithm can be improved. Another avenue of improvement is the interpretation of the SPADE tree, which involves visual inspection of multiple colored versions of the tree based on expression of measured markers. This is essentially manual gating on the SPADE tree and can benefit from automated algorithms. This article presents improvements of SPADE in both aspects above, leading to a deterministic SPADE algorithm and a software implementation for semiautomated interpretation. © 2017 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry."

Functional and phenotypic characterization of peripheral blood neutrophils revealed more mature and responsive neutrophils in young females, which also exhibited an elevated capacity in neutrophil extracellular trap formation at baseline and upon microbial or sterile autoimmune stimuli. The expression levels of the immature-like neutrophil signature increased linearly with pregnancy, an immune state of increased susceptibility to certain infections.

The phospho-kinase antibody array screen was used to explore the underlying mechanism of PARPi-induced PD-L1 upregulation. The therapeutic efficacy of PARPi alone, PD-L1 blockade alone, or their combination was tested in a syngeneic tumor model. The tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor cells isolated from syngeneic tumors were analyzed by CyTOF and FACS to evaluate the activity of antitumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment.Results: PARPi upregulated PD-L1 expression in breast cancer cell lines and animal models. Mechanistically, PARPi inactivated GSK3β, which in turn enhanced PARPi-mediated PD-L1 upregulation. PARPi attenuated anticancer immunity via upregulation of PD-L1, and blockade of PD-L1 resensitized PARPi-treated cancer cells to T-cell killing. The combination of PARPi and anti-PD-L1 therapy compared with each agent alone significantly increased the therapeutic efficacy in vivoConclusions: Our study demonstrates a cross-talk between PARPi and tumor-associated immunosuppression and provides evidence to support the combination of PARPi and PD-L1 or PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade as a potential therapeutic approach to treat breast cancer.

Mass cytometry enables multi-dimensional, single-cell analysis of cell type and state. In mass cytometry, the rare earth metals used as reporters on antibodies allow determination of marker expression in individual cells. Barcode-based bioassays for CyTOF are able to encode and decode for different experimental conditions or samples within the same experiment, facilitating progress in producing straightforward and consistent results. Herein, an integrated protocol for automated sample preparation for barcoding used in conjunction with mass cytometry for clinical bioanalysis samples is described; we offer results of our work with barcoding protocol optimization. In addition, we present some points to be considered in order to minimize the variability of quantitative mass cytometry measurements. For example, we discuss the importance of having multiple populations during titration of the antibodies and effect of storage and shipping of labelled samples on the stability of staining for purposes of CyTOF analysis. Data quality is not affected when labelled samples are stored either frozen or at 4 °C and used within 10 days; we observed that cell loss is greater if cells are washed with deionized water prior to shipment or are shipped in lower concentration. Once the labelled samples for CyTOF are suspended in deionized water, the analysis should be performed expeditiously, preferably within the first hour. Damage can be minimized if the cells are resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) rather than deionized water while waiting for data acquisition."

However, studies in cancer immunotherapy have focused heavily on local immune responses in the tumor microenvironment. To investigate immune activity more broadly, we performed an organism-wide study in genetically engineered cancer models using mass cytometry. We analyzed immune responses in several tissues after immunotherapy by developing intuitive models for visualizing single-cell data with statistical inference. Immune activation was evident in the tumor and systemically shortly after effective therapy was administered. However, during tumor rejection, only peripheral immune cells sustained their proliferation. This systemic response was coordinated across tissues and required for tumor eradication in several immunotherapy models. An emergent population of peripheral CD4 T cells conferred protection against new tumors and was significantly expanded in patients responding to immunotherapy. These studies demonstrate the critical impact of systemic immune responses that drive tumor rejection."

Both peripheral blood (PB) and tumor samples were immunophenotyped during treatment. Although in vitro dasatinib displayed no direct cytotoxicity to B16 melanoma cells, a significant decrease in tumor growth was observed in dasatinib-treated mice compared with vehicle-treated group. Further, dasatinib-treated melanoma-bearing mice had an increased proportion of CD8+ T cells in PB, together with a higher amount of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Dasatinib-mediated antitumor efficacy was abolished when CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were depleted with antibodies. Results were confirmed in sarcoma, colon, and breast cancer models, and in all cases mice treated daily with dasatinib had a significant decrease in tumor growth. Detailed immunophenotyping of tumor tissues with CyTOF indicated that dasatinib had reduced the number of intratumoral regulatory T cells in all tumor types. To conclude, dasatinib is able to slow down the tumor growth of various solid tumor models, which is associated with the favorable blood/tumor T-cell immunomodulation. The assessment of synergistic combinatorial therapies with other immunomodulatory drugs or targeted small-molecule oncokinase inhibitors is warranted in future clinical trials.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a model used to study various aspects of MS, including the infiltration of autoaggressive T cells and pathogenic, inflammatory myeloid cells into the CNS. Various signature landscapes of immune cell infiltrates have proven useful in shedding light on the causes of specific EAE symptoms in transgenic mice. However, single cell analysis of these infiltrates has thus far been limited in conventional fluorescent flow cytometry methods by 14-16 parameter staining panels. With the advent of mass cytometry and metal-tagged antibodies, a staining panel of 35-45 parameters is now possible. With the aid of dimensionality reducing and clustering algorithms to visualize and analyze this high dimensional data, this allows for a more comprehensive picture of the different cell populations in an inflamed CNS, at a single cell resolution level.

JAK2 has the potential to activate multiple other signaling molecules, either directly through downstream effectors, or indirectly through induction of target gene expression. We have interrogated myeloproliferative signaling in myelofibrosis (MF) and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) patient samples using mass cytometry, which allows the quantitative measurement of multiple signaling molecules simultaneously at the single-cell level, in cell populations representing a nearly complete spectrum of hematopoiesis. MF and sAML malignant cells demonstrated a high prevalence of hyperactivation of the JAK-STAT, MAP kinase, PI3 kinase and NFκB signaling pathways. Constitutive NFκB signaling was evident across MF and sAML patients. A supporting gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of MF showed many NFκB target genes to be expressed above normal levels in MF patient CD34+ cells.

In polymicrobial sepsis initiated by cecal ligation and puncture, RvD2 (∼2.7 nmol/mouse) significantly increased survival (>50%) of wild-type mice and reduced hypothermia and bacterial titers compared with vehicle-treated cecal ligation and puncture mice that succumbed at 48 h. Protection by RvD2 was abolished in DRV2-KO mice. Mass spectrometry-based lipid mediator metabololipidomics demonstrated that DRV2-KO infectious exudates gave higher proinflammatory leukotriene B4 and procoagulating thromboxane B2, as well as lower specialized proresolving mediators, including RvD1 and RvD3, compared with wild-type. RvD2-DRV2-initiated intracellular signals were investigated using mass cytometry (cytometry by time-of-flight), which demonstrated that RvD2 enhanced phosphorylation of CREB, ERK1/2, and STAT3 in WT but not DRV2-KO macrophages. Monitored by real-time imaging, RvD2-DRV2 interaction significantly enhanced phagocytosis of live Escherichia coli, an action dependent on protein kinase A and STAT3 in macrophages. Taken together, we identified an RvD2/DRV2 axis that activates intracellular signaling pathways that increase phagocytosis-mediated bacterial clearance, survival, and organ protection.

We evaluated methods using several publicly available data sets from experiments in immunology, containing both major and rare cell populations, with cell population identities from expert manual gating as the reference standard. Several methods performed well, including FlowSOM, X-shift, PhenoGraph, Rclusterpp, and flowMeans. Among these, FlowSOM had extremely fast runtimes, making this method well-suited for interactive, exploratory analysis of large, high-dimensional data sets on a standard laptop or desktop computer. These results extend previously published comparisons by focusing on high-dimensional data and including new methods developed for CyTOF data.

In this study, we have employed 38-channel time-of-flight mass cytometry analysis to generate comprehensive immune cell signatures using matrix boolean analysis in a cohort of 28 stage IV melanoma patients and 17 controls. Clusters of parameters were constructed from the abundance of cellular phenotypes significantly different between patients and controls. This approach identified patient-specific combinatorial immune signatures consisting of high-resolution subsets of the T cell, NK cell, B cell, and myeloid compartments. An association with superior survival was characterized by a balanced distribution of myeloid-derived suppressor cell-like and APC-like myeloid phenotypes and differentiated NK cells. The results of this study in a discovery cohort of melanoma patients suggest that multifactorial immune signatures have the potential to allow more accurate prediction of individual patient outcome. Further investigation of the identified immune signatures in a validation cohort is now warranted."

The volumes and high dimensionality of mass cytometry data pose significant challenges in terms of analysis and visualization. We implement a method called Radviz, where multidimensional single cell data can be visualized as a projection that maintains the original dimensions and data complexity whilst facilitating analysis and visualization. This enables identification of changes in populations, focusing the analysis on the most relevant aspect of large multidimensional datasets. To highlight the potential of Radviz, we profiled peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMCs) from three healthy donors and showed donor-specific differences in the number and composition of cell populations. In a second study, we explored the anti-inflammatory effects of two glucocorticoid receptor (GR) ligands (cpd6 and cpd11) compared to dexamethasone (Dex) on human primary macrophages. Standard analysis at the population level showed that cpd6 and cpd11 have an overall anti-inflammatory profile similar to that of Dex. CyTOF profiling and Radviz-driven analysis at the single cell level confirmed this observation, and identified a concentration-dependent effect of cpd6 that was not detected at the population level.

The topology of these networks typically is only partially characterized due to experimental limitations. Current approaches for refining network topology are based on the explicit enumeration of alternative topologies and are therefore restricted to small problem instances with almost complete knowledge. We propose the reactionet lasso, a computational procedure that derives a stepwise sparse regression approach on the basis of the Chemical Master Equation, enabling large-scale structure learning for reaction networks by implicitly accounting for billions of topology variants. We have assessed the structure learning capabilities of the reactionet lasso on synthetic data for the complete TRAIL induced apoptosis signaling cascade comprising 70 reactions. We find that the reactionet lasso is able to efficiently recover the structure of these reaction systems, ab initio, with high sensitivity and specificity. With only < 1% false discoveries, the reactionet lasso is able to recover 45% of all true reactions ab initio among > 6000 possible reactions and over 102000 network topologies. In conjunction with information rich single cell technologies such as single cell RNA sequencing or mass cytometry, the reactionet lasso will enable large-scale structure learning, particularly in areas with partial network structure knowledge, such as cancer biology, and thereby enable the detection of pathological alterations of reaction networks. We provide software to allow for wide applicability of the reactionet lasso."

Continued improvement in cell population analysis methods like fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, CyTOF or single-cell omics made mathematical methods based on ergodic principles a powerful tool in studying these processes. In this paper, we establish the relationship between cell cycle analysis with ergodic principles and age structured population models. To this end, we describe the progression of a single cell through the cell cycle by a stochastic differential equation on a one dimensional manifold in the high dimensional dataspace of cell cycle markers. Given the assumption that the cell population is in a steady state, we derive transformation rules which transform the number density on the manifold to the steady state number density of age structured population models. Our theory facilitates the study of cell cycle dependent processes including local molecular events, cell death and cell division from high dimensional ""snapshot"" data. Ergodic analysis can in general be applied to every process that exhibits a steady state distribution. By combining ergodic analysis with age structured population models we furthermore provide the theoretic basis for extensions of ergodic principles to distribution that deviate from their steady state."

A single-cell debarcoding algorithm was previously developed to improve the accuracy and yield of sample deconvolution, but this method was limited to using fixed parameters for debarcoding stringency filtering, which could introduce cell-specific or sample-specific bias to cell yield in scenarios where barcode staining intensity and variance are not uniform across the pooled samples. To address this issue, we have updated the algorithm to output debarcoding parameters for every cell in the sample-assigned FCS files, which allows for visualization and analysis of these parameters via flow cytometry analysis software. This strategy can be used to detect cell type-specific and sample-specific effects on the underlying cell data that arise during the debarcoding process. An additional benefit to this strategy is the decoupling of barcode stringency filtering from the debarcoding and sample assignment process. This is accomplished by removing the stringency filters during sample assignment, and then filtering after the fact with 1- and 2-dimensional gating on the debarcoding parameters which are output with the FCS files. These data exploration strategies serve as an important quality check for barcoded mass cytometry datasets, and allow cell type and sample-specific stringency adjustment that can remove bias in cell yield introduced during the debarcoding process."

Epub 2016 Sep 9.,Article has no keywords,"Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes having vital functions in innate and adaptive immunity, as well as placental reproduction. Controlling education and functional activity of human NK cells are various receptors that recognize HLA class I on the surface of tissue cells. Epitopes of polymorphic HLA-A,-B and -C are recognized by equally diverse killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR). In addition, a peptide cleaved from the leader sequence of HLA-A,-B or -C must bind to HLA-E for it to become a ligand for the conserved CD94:NKG2A receptor. Methionine/threonine dimorphism at position -21 of the leader sequence divides HLA-B allotypes into a majority having -21T that do not supply HLA-E binding peptides and a minority having -21M, that do. Genetic analysis of human populations worldwide shows how haplotypes with -21M HLA-B rarely encode the KIR ligands: Bw4+HLA-B and C2+HLA-C KIR. Thus there are two fundamental forms of HLA haplotype: one preferentially supplying CD94:NKG2A ligands, the other preferentially supplying KIR ligands. -21 HLA-B dimorphism divides the human population into three groups: M/M, M/T and T/T. Mass cytometry and assays of immune function, shows how M/M and M/T individuals have CD94:NKG2A+ NK cells which are better educated, phenotypically more diverse and functionally more potent than those in T/T individuals. Fundamental new insights are given to genetic control of NK cell immunity and the evolution that has limited the number of NK cell receptor ligands encoded by an HLA haplotype. These finding suggest new ways to dissect the numerous clinical associations with HLA class I."

Cells with a CD34+CD38-CD45RA-CD90+CD49f+ (CD49f+) phenotype (∼10% HSCs with >6-month repopulating activity in immunodeficient mice) displayed rapid increases in activated STAT1/3/5, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, AKT, CREB, and S6 by 1 or more of these GFs, and β-catenin only when the 5 GFs were combined. Certain minority subsets within the CD49f+ compartment were poorly GF-responsive and, among the more GF-responsive subsets of CD49f+ cells, different signaling intermediates correlated with the levels of the myeloid- and lymphoid-associated transcription factors measured. Phenotypically similar, but CD90-CD49f- cells (MPPs) contained lower baseline levels of multiple signaling intermediates than the CD90+CD49f+ cells, but showed similar response amplitudes to the same GFs. Importantly, we found activation or inhibition of AKT and β-catenin directly altered immediate CD49f+ cell survival and proliferation. These findings identify rapid signaling events that 5 GFs elicit directly in the most primitive human hematopoietic cell types to promote their survival and proliferation."

Advancing our knowledge of the target tissue has been limited by the low dimensionality of histology techniques and the small size of human salivary gland biopsies. In this study, we took advantage of a molecularly validated mouse model of pSS to characterize tissue-infiltrating CD4+ T cells and their regulation by the lymphotoxin/LIGHT signaling axis. Novel cell subsets were identified by combining highly dimensional flow and mass cytometry with transcriptomic analyses. Pharmacologic modulation of the LTβR signaling pathway was achieved by treating mice with LTβR-Ig, a therapeutic intervention currently being tested in pSS patients (Baminercept trial NCT01552681). Using these approaches, we identified two novel CD4+ T cell subsets characterized by high levels of PD1: Prdm1+ effector regulatory T cells expressing immunoregulatory factors, such as Il10, Areg, Fgl2, and Itgb8, and Il21+ effector conventional T cells expressing a pathogenic transcriptional signature. Mirroring these observations in mice, large numbers of CD4+PD1+ T cells were detected in salivary glands from Sjögren's patients but not in normal salivary glands or kidney biopsies from lupus nephritis patients. Unexpectedly, LTβR-Ig selectively halted the recruitment of PD1- naive, but not PD1+, effector T cells to the target tissue, leaving the cells with pathogenic potential unaffected. Altogether, this study revealed new cellular players in pSS pathogenesis, their transcriptional signatures, and differential dependency on the lymphotoxin/LIGHT signaling axis that help to interpret the negative results of the Baminercept trial and will guide future therapeutic interventions."

However, mechanisms for selective activation of CD4Tregs and the effects of low-dose IL-2 on other immune cells are not well understood. Using mass cytometry, we demonstrate that low concentrations of IL-2 selectively induce STAT5 phosphorylation in Helios+ CD4Tregs and CD56brightCD16- NK cells in vitro. Preferential activation and expansion of Helios+ CD4Tregs and CD56brightCD16- NK cells was also demonstrated in patients with chronic GVHD receiving low-dose IL-2.

Asthmatic patients have wide variation in clinical severity with different clinical and physiologic manifestations of disease that may be driven by distinct biologic mechanisms. Further, the immunologic underpinnings of this complex trait disease are heterogeneous and treatment success depends on defining subgroups of asthmatics. Because of the limited availability and number of cells from the lung, the active site, in-depth investigation has been challenging. Recent advances in technology support transcriptional analysis of cells from induced sputum. Flow cytometry studies have described cells present in the sputum but a detailed analysis of these subsets is lacking. Mass cytometry or CyTOF (Cytometry by Time-Of-Flight) offers tremendous opportunities for multiparameter single cell analysis. Experiments can now allow detection of up to ∼40 markers to facilitate unprecedented multidimensional cellular analyses.

It is anticipated that the quantities of cells needed for these applications will be in the order of 109-1010 cells, because of the size of the liver. An ideal differentiation protocol would be to enable directed differentiation to the hepatocyte lineage with simultaneous cell expansion. We introduced a cell expansion stage after the commitment of human embryonic stem cells to the endodermal lineage, to allow for at least an eightfold increase in cell number, with continuation of cell maturation toward the hepatocyte lineage. The progressive changes in the transcriptome were measured by expression array, and the expression dynamics of certain lineage markers was measured by mass cytometry during the differentiation and expansion process. The findings revealed that while cells were expanding they were also capable of progressing in their differentiation toward the hepatocyte lineage. In addition, our transcriptome, protein and functional studies, including albumin secretion, drug-induced CYP450 expression and urea production, all indicated that the hepatocyte-like cells obtained with or without cell expansion are very similar. This method of simultaneous cell expansion and hepatocyte differentiation should facilitate obtaining large quantities of cells for liver cell applications."

Issues like equipment breakdown and sampling of large-scale batches, which may require multiple days of data acquisition, are minor but critical obstacles that prompt a technical solution, especially when dealing with precious samples. An ability to cryopreserve mass cytometry samples that have already been stained would alleviate numerous technical limitations we face with currently used sample-handling approaches. Here, we evaluated two protocols for freezing of already-stained and fixed cellular samples and compared them with standard sample refrigeration in staining buffer. A comprehensive human T cell staining phenotypic and functional profiling panel was used and the signal intensity and reliability of each marker was assessed over a 4-week period. In general, cellular viability, DNA Ir-Intercalator and barcode staining were minimally affected by freezing compared to refrigeration, and the signal intensities for cell surface markers and receptors were not compromised. Intracellular cytokine staining did show some decreases in signal intensity after freezing, with the decreases more prominent in a methanol-based protocol compared to a protocol involving the use of 10% DMSO in FBS. We conclude that freezing already-stained samples suspended in 10% DMSO in FBS is practical and efficient way to preserve already-stained samples when needed. © 2016 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry."

However, MPN-MF often progresses (~20%) to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML), where standard induction chemotherapy or ruxolitinib is relatively ineffective, necessitating the development of novel therapeutic approaches. In the present studies, we demonstrate that treatment with BET (bromodomain and extraterminal) protein inhibitor (BETi), for example, JQ1, inhibits growth and induces apoptosis of cultured and primary, patient-derived (PD), post-MPN sAML blast progenitor cells. Reverse-phase protein array, mass-cytometry and Western analyses revealed that BETi treatment attenuated the protein expressions of c-MYC, p-STAT5, Bcl-xL, CDK4/6, PIM1 and IL-7R, whereas it concomitantly induced the levels of HEXIM1, p21 and BIM in the sAML cells. Co-treatment with BETi and ruxolitinib synergistically induced apoptosis of cultured and PD sAML cells, as well as significantly improved survival of immune-depleted mice engrafted with human sAML cells. Although BETi or heat shock protein 90 inhibitor (HSP90i) alone exerted lethal activity, cotreatment with BETi and HSP90i was synergistically lethal against the ruxolitinib-persister or ruxolitinib-resistant sAML cells. Collectively, these findings further support in vivo testing of BETi-based combinations with JAKi and HSP90i against post-MPN sAML cells."

However, to date, mass cytometry has lacked a reliable alternative to the light scatter properties that are commonly used as a cell size metric in flow cytometry (forward scatter intensity-FSC). Here, we report the development of two plasma membrane staining assays to evaluate mammalian cell size in mass cytometry experiments. One is based on wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) staining and the other on Osmium tetroxide (OsO4 ) staining, both of which have preferential affinity for cell membranes. We first perform imaging and flow cytometry experiments to establish a relationship between WGA staining intensity and traditional measures of cell size. We then incorporate WGA staining in mass cytometry analysis of human whole blood and show that WGA staining intensity has reproducible patterns within and across immune cell subsets that have distinct cell sizes. Lastly, we stain PBMCs or dissociated lung tissue with both WGA and OsO4 ; mass cytometry analysis demonstrates that the two staining intensities correlate well with one another. We conclude that both WGA and OsO4 may be used to acquire cell size-related parameters in mass cytometry experiments, and expect these stains to be broadly useful in expanding the range of parameters that can be measured in mass cytometry experiments. © 2016 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry."

Although several analysis tools are available to interpret the complex data sets generated, a robust method for standardization and quality control within and across studies is needed. Here we report an efficient and easily adaptable method to monitor quality of individual samples in human immunology studies and to facilitate reproducible data analysis. Samples to be assessed are spiked with a defined amount of reference peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a healthy donor, derived from a single large blood draw. The presence of known standardized numbers and phenotypic profiles of these reference cells greatly facilitates sample analysis by allowing for: 1) quality control for consistent staining of each antibody in the panel, 2) identification of potential batch effects, and 3) implementation of a robust gating strategy. We demonstrate the utility of this method using peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage samples from HIV+ patients by characterizing their CD8+ T-cell phenotypes and cytokine expression, respectively. Our results indicate that this method allows quality control of experimental conditions and results in highly reproducible population frequencies through a robust gating strategy. © 2016 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry."

To examine the effects of sulfide on relevant intracellular signaling in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we stimulated healthy donor PBMCs with sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, 1-1000μM) to mimic H2S stimulation, and analyzed phosphorylation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) (pT180/pY182), NF-κB p65 (pS529), Akt (pS473) and CREB/ATF1 (pS133/pS63) with flow and mass cytometry. In contrast to transient effects in subsets of lymphocytes, classical monocytes demonstrated sustained phosphorylation of p38, Akt and CREB/ATF1. NaHS induced calcium dependent phosphorylation of p38, Akt and CREB, but not NF-κB, and the phosphorylation of Akt was partly dependent on p38, indicative of p38-Akt crosstalk. Attenuation of these effects by molecules targeting p38 and Hsp90 indicated Hsp90 as a possible target for H2S-induced activation of p38. These results provide a description of a NaHS-induced signal transduction pathway in human primary immune cells that may have relevance for the role of sulfides in inflammation."

Epub 2016 Oct 18.,Keywords: CyTOF; FLOCK; PhenoGraph; SPADE; automated clustering; cluster stability; data analysis.,"Manual gating has been traditionally applied to cytometry data sets to identify cells based on protein expression. The advent of mass cytometry allows for a higher number of proteins to be simultaneously measured on cells, therefore providing a means to define cell clusters in a high dimensional expression space. This enhancement, whilst opening unprecedented opportunities for single cell-level analyses, makes the incremental replacement of manual gating with automated clustering a compelling need. To this aim many methods have been implemented and their successful applications demonstrated in different settings. However, the reproducibility of automatically generated clusters is proving challenging and an analytical framework to distinguish spurious clusters from more stable entities, and presumably more biologically relevant ones, is still missing. One way to estimate cell clusters' stability is the evaluation of their consistent re-occurrence within- and between-algorithms, a metric that is commonly used to evaluate results from gene expression. Herein we report the usage and importance of cluster stability evaluations, when applied to results generated from three popular clustering algorithms - SPADE, FLOCK and PhenoGraph - run on four different data sets. These algorithms were shown to generate clusters with various degrees of statistical stability, many of them being unstable. By comparing the results of automated clustering with manually gated populations, we illustrate how information on cluster stability can assist towards a more rigorous and informed interpretation of clustering results. We also explore the relationships between statistical stability and other properties such as clusters' compactness and isolation, demonstrating that whilst cluster stability is linked to other properties it cannot be reliably predicted by any of them. Our study proposes the introduction of cluster stability as a necessary checkpoint for cluster interpretation and contributes to the construction of a more systematic and standardized analytical framework for the assessment of cytometry clustering results. © 2016 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry."

This technique, called FFPE-DISSECT (disaggregation for intracellular signaling in single epithelial cells from tissue), is a single-cell approach to characterizing signaling states in embedded tissue samples. We applied FFPE-DISSECT coupled to mass cytometry and found differential signaling by tumor necrosis factor-α in intestinal enterocytes, goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells, implicating the downstream RAS-RAF-MEK pathway in determining goblet cell identity. Application of this technique and computational analyses to human colon specimens confirmed the reduced differentiation in colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to normal colon and revealed increased intratissue and intertissue heterogeneity in CRC with quantitative changes in the regulation of signaling pathways. Specifically, coregulation of the kinases p38 and ERK, the translation regulator 4EBP1, and the transcription factor CREB in proliferating normal colon cells was lost in CRC. Our data suggest that this single-cell approach, applied in conjunction with genomic annotation, enables the rapid and detailed characterization of cellular heterogeneity from clinical repositories of embedded human tissues. This technique can be used to derive cellular landscapes from archived patient samples (beyond CRC) and as a high-resolution tool for disease characterization and subtyping."

We demonstrated that human memory-like NK cells have enhanced interferon-γ production and cytotoxicity against leukemia cell lines or primary human AML blasts in vitro. Using mass cytometry, we found that memory-like NK cell functional responses were triggered against primary AML blasts, regardless of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) to KIR-ligand interactions. In addition, multidimensional analyses identified distinct phenotypes of control and memory-like NK cells from the same individuals. Human memory-like NK cells xenografted into mice substantially reduced AML burden in vivo and improved overall survival. In the context of a first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial, adoptively transferred memory-like NK cells proliferated and expanded in AML patients and demonstrated robust responses against leukemia targets.

Of particular importance are controls that reveal, and panel design principles that mitigate the effects of signal interference or overlap. We observed a disparity between the staining profiles of two noncompeting anti- integrin β7 mAbs and hypothesized that signal interference was responsible. A mass-minus-one (MMO) control was applied and demonstrated that signal overlap caused the perceived interclonal discrepancy in β7 expression. Panel redesign in consideration of mass-cytometry specific interference dynamics dramatically improved concordance between both mAbs by redistributing background signals caused by overlap. These studies visualize how signal overlap can complicate mass cytometry data interpretation and demonstrate how the rational distribution of interference can greatly improve panel design and data quality. © 2016 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry."

We hypothesized that concomitant targeting of BCL-2 and BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase could overcome these limitations. We demonstrate increased BCL-2 expression at the protein level in bone marrow cells, particularly in Lin(-)Sca-1(+)cKit(+) cells of inducible CML in mice, as determined by CyTOF mass cytometry. Further, selective inhibition of BCL-2, aided by TKI-mediated MCL-1 and BCL-XL inhibition, markedly decreased leukemic Lin(-)Sca-1(+)cKit(+) cell numbers and long-term stem cell frequency and prolonged survival in a murine CML model. Additionally, this combination effectively eradicated CD34(+)CD38(-), CD34(+)CD38(+), and quiescent stem/progenitor CD34(+) cells from BC CML patient samples. Our results suggest that BCL-2 is a key survival factor for CML stem/progenitor cells and that combined inhibition of BCL-2 and BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase has the potential to significantly improve depth of response and cure rates of chronic-phase and BC CML."

Monitoring of immune dysfunction is a prerequisite for the development of strategies aiming to alleviate cancer-induced immune suppression. At this point, the level at which immune dysfunction occurs has to be established, the underlying mechanism(s) need to be known, as well as the techniques to assess this. While it is relatively easy to measure general signs of immune suppression, it turns out that accurate monitoring of the frequency and function of immune-suppressive cells is still difficult. A lack of truly specific markers, the phenotypic complexity among suppressive cells of the same lineage, but potentially with different functions and functional assays that may not cover every mechanistic aspect of immune suppression are among the reasons complicating proper assessments.

Here, we combine genome-wide RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq to compare the transcriptional and epigenetic identity of small intestinal ILCs, identifying thousands of distinct gene profiles and regulatory elements. Single-cell RNA-seq and flow and mass cytometry analyses reveal compartmentalization of cytokine expression and metabolic activity within the three classical ILC subtypes and highlight transcriptional states beyond the current canonical classification. In addition, using antibiotic intervention and germ-free mice, we characterize the effect of the microbiome on the ILC regulatory landscape and determine the response of ILCs to microbial colonization at the single-cell level. Together, our work characterizes the spectrum of transcriptional identities of small intestinal ILCs and describes how ILCs differentially integrate signals from the microbial microenvironment to generate phenotypic and functional plasticity."

To prepare highly purified cell suspensions of peripheral blood lymphocytes for further analysis on mass cytometer, we used the new CD81+ immune affinity chromatography cell isolation approach. Using 21 metal conjugated antibodies in a single tube we were able to identify all basic cell subsets and compare their relative abundance in final products obtained by density gradient (Ficoll-Paque) and immune affinity chromatography (CD81+ T-catch™) isolation approach. We show that T-catch isolation approach results in purer final product than Ficoll-Paque (P values 0.0156), with fewer platelets bound to target cells. As a result acquisition time of 105 nucleated cells was 3.5 shorter. We then applied unsupervised high dimensional analysis viSNE algorithm to compare the two isolation protocols, which allowed us to evaluate the contribution of unsupervised analysis over supervised manual gating. ViSNE algorithm effectively characterized almost all supervised cell subsets. Moreover, viSNE uncovered previously overseen cell subsets and showed inaccuracies in Maxpar™ Human peripheral blood phenotyping panel kit recommended gating strategy. These findings emphasize the use of unsupervised analysis tools in parallel with conventional gating strategy to mine the complete information from a set of samples.

Phosphoflow assays combine phosphoprotein-specific antibodies with the power of flow cytometry to enhance phosphoprotein study. In our assay, peripheral blood mononuclear cells are stimulated by cytokines, fixed, surface-stained with a cocktail of antibodies labeled with MAXPAR (brand name) metal-chelating polymers and permeabilized with methanol. They are then stained with intracellular phospho-specific antibodies. We use a CyTOF™ mass cytometer to acquire the ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) data. The current mass window selected is approximately AW 103-203, which includes the lanthanides used for most antibody labeling, as well as iridium and rhodium for DNA intercalators. Subsequent analysis of the dual count signal data using FlowJo software allows for cell types to be analyzed based on the dual count signal in each mass channel. The percentage of each cell type is determined and reported as a percent of the parent cell type. Median values are reported to quantitate the level of phosphorylation of each protein in response to stimulation. Comparing the level of phosphorylation between samples can offer insight to the status of the immune system."

The use of inbred mouse strains enabled controlled studies of immune cell and molecule functions in defined settings. These studies were usually performed in specific-pathogen free (SPF) environments providing standardized conditions. In contrast, mammalians including humans living in their natural habitat are continuously facing pathogen encounters throughout their life. The influences of environmental conditions on the signatures of the immune system and on experimental outcomes are yet not well defined. Thus, the transferability of results obtained in current experimental systems to the physiological human situation has always been a matter of debate. Studies elucidating the diversity of ""wild immunology"" imprintings in detail and comparing it with those of ""clean"" lab mice are sparse. Here, we applied multidimensional mass cytometry to dissect phenotypic and functional differences between distinct groups of laboratory and pet shop mice as a source for ""wild mice"". For this purpose, we developed a 31-antibody panel for murine leukocyte subsets identification and a 35-antibody panel assessing various cytokines. Established murine leukocyte populations were easily identified and diverse immune signatures indicative of numerous pathogen encounters were classified particularly in pet shop mice and to a lesser extent in quarantine and non-SPF mice as compared to SPF mice. In addition, unsupervised analysis identified distinct clusters that associated strongly with the degree of pathogenic priming, including increased frequencies of activated NK cells and antigen-experienced B- and T-cell subsets. Our study unravels the complexity of immune signatures altered under physiological pathogen challenges and highlights the importance of carefully adapting laboratory settings for immunological studies in mice, including drug and therapy testing. © 2016 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry."

The active-site mTOR inhibitors (asTORi) represent a promising new approach to targeting mTOR in AKT/mTOR signaling. MLN0128 is an orally-administered, second-generation asTORi, currently in clinical development. We examined the anti-leukemic effects and the mechanisms of action of MLN0128 in AML cell lines and primary samples, with a particular focus on its effect in AML stem/progenitor cells. MLN0128 inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in AML by attenuating the activity of mTOR complex 1 and 2. Using time-of-flight mass cytometry, we demonstrated that MLN0128 selectively targeted and functionally inhibited AML stem/progenitor cells with high AKT/mTOR signaling activity. Using the reverse-phase protein array technique, we measured expression and phosphorylation changes in response to MLN0128 in 151 proteins from 24 primary AML samples and identified several pro-survival pathways that antagonize MLN0128-induced cellular stress. A combined blockade of AKT/mTOR signaling and these pro-survival pathways facilitated AML cell killing. Our findings provide a rationale for the clinical use of MLN0128 to target AML and AML stem/progenitor cells, and support the use of combinatorial multi-targeted approaches in AML therapy."

We used 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs' (DREADDs) to directly activate dopaminergic neurons in the mouse VTA and characterized the subsequent immune response after exposure to bacteria (Escherichia coli), using time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) and functional assays. We found an increase in innate and adaptive immune responses that were manifested by enhanced antibacterial activity of monocytes and macrophages, reduced in vivo bacterial load and a heightened T cell response in the mouse model of delayed-type hypersensitivity. By chemically ablating the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), we showed that the reward system's effects on immunity are, at least partly, mediated by the SNS.

To this end, we here establish the application of elemental silver nanoparticles (AgNP) of different size for reporting cell surface antigens on human leukocytes in mass cytometry assays. The mass channels at 107 Da and 109 Da are uniquely occupied by silver isotopes and do not interfere with other mass cytometry reagents. Streptavidin-coated AgNP (SA-AgNP) facilitated distinct and specific detection of various antigens, such as CD8, CD244 and CD294 on peripheral blood leukocytes pre-incubated with respective biotinylated primary antibodies. Signal intensities elicited by 40 nm-sized AgNP allowed specific detection of the low abundance antigen CD25 on both, peripheral blood regulatory T cells and CD25lo CD127+ CD4+ T cells, enabling their distinct clustering in viSNE plots. SA-AgNP were of high elemental purity, showed minor background binding to cells in immunoassays, and were compatible with previously established staining protocols for PBMC and leukocytes, facilitating their use in complex mass cytometry panels.

Using mass cytometry and an unbiased multidimensional analytical approach, we identified 2 specific human Treg subpopulations (Treg A and Treg B) with distinct phenotypes, gene expression, expandability, and function. Treg B predominates in IST responder patients, has a memory/activated phenotype (with higher expression of CD95, CCR4, and CD45RO within FOXP3(hi), CD127(lo) Tregs), expresses the interleukin-2 (IL-2)/STAT5 pathway and cell-cycle commitment genes. Furthermore, in vitro-expanded Tregs become functional and take on the characteristics of Treg B. Collectively, this study identifies human Treg subpopulations that can be used as predictive biomarkers for response to IST in AA and potentially other autoimmune diseases. We also show that Tregs from AA patients are IL-2-sensitive and expandable in vitro, suggesting novel therapeutic approaches such as low-dose IL-2 therapy and/or expanded autologous Tregs and meriting further exploration."

In particular, we focus on the age-dependent dysregulation of innate immune cell types-neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells-in response to WNV infection, as well as age-related alterations in NK cells and γδ T cells that may associate with increased WNV susceptibility in older people. We also highlight two advanced technologies, i.e., mass cytometry and microRNA profiling, which significantly contribute to systems-level study of immune dysregulation in aging and should facilitate new discoveries for therapeutic intervention against WNV."

Mass cytometry (CyTOF) is being used to increase the number of markers that can be investigated in single cells, and therefore characterize cell phenotype at an unprecedented level. We designed a panel of CyTOF Abs to compare the B cell response in cynomolgus macaques at baseline, and 8 and 28 d after the second homologous immunization with modified vaccinia virus Ankara. The spanning-tree progression analysis of density-normalized events (SPADE) algorithm was used to identify clusters of CD20(+) B cells. Our data revealed the phenotypic complexity and diversity of circulating B cells at steady-state and significant vaccine-induced changes in the proportions of some B cell clusters. All SPADE clusters, including those altered quantitatively by vaccination, were characterized phenotypically and compared using double hierarchical clustering. Vaccine-altered clusters composed of previously described subsets including CD27(hi)CD21(lo) activated memory and CD27(+)CD21(+) resting memory B cells, and subphenotypes with novel patterns of marker coexpression. The expansion, followed by the contraction, of a single memory B cell SPADE cluster was positively correlated with serum anti-vaccine Ab titers. Similar results were generated by a different algorithm, automatic classification of cellular expression by nonlinear stochastic embedding. In conclusion, we present an in-depth characterization of B cell subphenotypes and proportions, before and after vaccination, using a two-step clustering analysis of CyTOF data, which is suitable for longitudinal studies and B cell subsets and biomarkers discovery."

We examined functional and molecular features of PD-1hi Tregs in healthy subjects and patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), combining functional assays, RNA sequencing, and cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF). In both patients with GBM and healthy subjects, circulating PD-1hi Tregs displayed reduced suppression of CD4+ effector T cells, production of IFN-γ, and molecular signatures of exhaustion. Transcriptional profiling of tumor-resident Tregs revealed that several genes coexpressed with PD-1 and associated with IFN-γ production and exhaustion as well as enrichment in exhaustion signatures compared with circulating PD-1hi Tregs. CyTOF analysis of circulating and tumor-infiltrating Tregs from patients with GBM treated with PD-1-blocking antibodies revealed that treatment shifts the profile of circulating Tregs toward a more exhausted phenotype reminiscent of that of tumor-infiltrating Tregs, further increasing IFN-γ production. Thus, high PD-1 expression on human Tregs identifies dysfunctional, exhausted Tregs secreting IFN-γ that exist in healthy individuals and are enriched in tumor infiltrates, possibly losing function as they attempt to modulate the antitumoral immune responses."

These responses are governed by an evolving milieu of cancer and immune cell subpopulations that can be a rich source of biomarkers and biological insight, but it is only recently that research tools have developed to comprehensively characterize this level of cellular complexity. Mass cytometry is particularly well suited to tracking cells in complex tissues because >35 measurements can be made on each of hundreds of thousands of cells per sample, allowing all cells detected in a sample to be characterized for cell type, signalling activity, and functional outcome. This review focuses on mass cytometry as an example of systems level characterization of cancer and immune cells in human tissues, including blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and primary tumours. This review also discusses the state of the art in single cell tumour immunology, including tissue collection, technical and biological quality controls, computational analysis, and integration of different experimental and clinical data types. Ex vivo analysis of human tumour cells complements both in vivo monitoring, which generally measures far fewer features or lacks single cell resolution, and laboratory models, which incur cell type losses, signalling alterations, and genomic changes during establishment. Mass cytometry is on the leading edge of a new generation of cytomic tools that work with small tissue samples, such as a fine needle aspirates or blood draws, to monitor changes in rare or unexpected cell subsets during cancer therapy. This approach holds great promise for dissecting cellular microenvironments, monitoring how treatments affect tissues, revealing cellular biomarkers and effector mechanisms, and creating new treatments that productively engage the immune system to fight cancer and other diseases."

Both fronts of advance have exposed a rich heterogeneity of cell states within uniform cell populations in many biological contexts, producing a new kind of data that has triggered computational analysis methods for data visualization, dimensionality reduction, and cluster (subpopulation) identification. The next step is now to go beyond collecting data and correlating data points: to connect the dots, that is, to understand what actually underlies the identified data patterns. This entails interpreting the 'clouds of points' in state space as a manifestation of the underlying molecular regulatory network. In that way control of cell state dynamics can be formalized as a quasi-potential landscape, as first proposed by Waddington.

Using 30-channel mass cytometry data, we show that Wishbone accurately recovers the known stages of T-cell development in the mouse thymus, including the bifurcation point. We also apply the algorithm to mouse myeloid differentiation and demonstrate its generalization to additional lineages. A comparison of Wishbone to diffusion maps, SCUBA and Monocle shows that it outperforms these methods both in the accuracy of ordering cells and in the correct identification of branch points."

Over the last few years, powerful highly multiplexed epitope-based imaging approaches that rely on the serial imaging of tissues with fluorescently labeled antibodies and the simultaneous analysis using metal-labeled antibodies have emerged. These techniques enable analysis of dozens of epitopes in thousands of cells in a single experiment providing a systems level view of normal and disease processes at the single-cell level with spatial resolution in tissues. In this Review, I discuss, first, the highly multiplexed epitope-based imaging approaches and the generated data. Second, I describe challenges that must be overcome to implement these imaging methods from bench to bedside, including issues with tissue processing and analyses of the large amounts of data generated. Third, I discuss how these methods can be integrated with readouts of genome, transcriptome, metabolome, and live cell information, and fourth, the novel applications possible in tissue biology, drug development, and biomarker discovery. I anticipate that highly multiplexed epitope-based imaging approaches will broadly complement existing imaging methods and will become a cornerstone of tissue biology and biomedical research and of precision medical applications."

The mass cytometry or CyTOF, platform allows for the parallel application of about 40 labeled antibodies to a single sample, creating the possibility to read out many cell types and signaling pathways in a single small blood sample. We developed such a mass cytometry panel, consisting of 22 antibodies to cell surface lineage markers and 8 antibodies to phospho-specific epitopes of signaling proteins. These antibodies were chosen to discriminate all major white blood cell lineages, to a level of detail that includes subsets such as naïve, central memory, effector memory, and late effector CD4+ and CD8+T cells, naïve, transitional, and switched memory B cells, plasmablasts, myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, CD16+ and CD16+CD56+ NK cells, CD16+ and classical monocytes etc. 32 such cell subsets are defined in our standard gating scheme. The eight phospho-specific antibodies were chosen to represent major signaling nodes responsive to cytokine, TLR, and antigen receptor signaling. This antibody panel is used with 8 standard stimulation conditions (unstimulated, IFNa, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-21, LPS, PMA+ ionomycin), although other stimuli can be added. Comparison of healthy controls to subjects with immune deficiencies of unknown etiology may help elucidate the mechanisms of such deficiencies. Phosphorylation of tyrosine, serine, and threonine residues is critical for the control of protein activity involved in various cellular events. An assortment of kinases and phosphatases regulate intracellular protein phosphorylation in many different cell signaling pathways, such as T and B cell signaling, those regulating apoptosis, growth and cell cycle control, plus those involved with cytokine, chemokine, and stress responses. Phosphoflow assays combine phospho-specific antibodies with the power of flow cytometry to enhance phospho protein study. In our assay, peripheral blood mononuclear cells are stimulated by cytokines, fixed, surface-stained with a cocktail of antibodies labeled with MAXPAR (Brand Name) metal-chelating polymers and permeabilized with methanol. They are then stained with intracellular phospho-specific antibodies. We use a CyTOF™ mass cytometer to acquire the ICP-MS data. The current mass window selected is approximately AW 103-203, which includes the lanthanides used for most antibody labeling, as well as iridium and rhodium for DNA intercalators. Subsequent analysis of the dual count signal data using FlowJo software allows for cell types to be analyzed based on the dual count signal in each mass channel. The percentage of each cell type is determined and reported as a percent of the parent cell type. Median values are reported to quantitate the level of phosphorylation of each protein in response to stimulation. Comparing the level of phosphorylation between samples can offer insight to the status of the immune system. Whole blood stimulation is the closest to the in vivo condition and it allows for assessment of granulocyte population as well as lymphocytes and monocytes."

To characterize changes in cell phenotype before, during, and immediately after induction treatment, we developed a 27-antibody panel for mass cytometry focused on surface diagnostic markers and applied it to 46 samples of blood or bone marrow tissue collected over time from 5 AML patients. Central goals were to determine whether changes in AML phenotype would be captured effectively by cytomic tools and to implement methods for describing the evolving phenotypes of AML cell subsets. Mass cytometry data were analyzed using established computational techniques. Within this pilot study, longitudinal immune monitoring with mass cytometry revealed fundamental changes in leukemia phenotypes that occurred over time during and after induction in the refractory disease setting. Persisting AML blasts became more phenotypically distinct from stem and progenitor cells due to expression of novel marker patterns that differed from pre-treatment AML cells and from all cell types observed in healthy bone marrow.

The method for sample multiplexing in mass cytometry, called mass-tag cellular barcoding (MCB), relies on the covalent reaction of bifunctional metal chelators with intracellular proteins. Here, we describe the use of osmium and ruthenium tetroxides (OsO4 and RuO4 ) that bind covalently with fatty acids in the cellular membranes and aromatic amino acids in proteins. Both OsO4 and RuO4 rapidly reacted and allowed for MCB with live cells, crosslinked cells, and permeabilized cells. Given the covalent nature of the labeling reaction, isotope leaching was not observed. OsO4 and RuO4 were used in a 20-sample barcoding protocol together with palladium isotopes. As mass channels occupied by osmium and ruthenium are not used for antibody detection the number of masses effectively utilized in a single experiment is expanded. OsO4 and RuO4 can therefore be used as MCB reagents for a wide range of mass cytometry workflows. © 2016 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry."

In primary cells, we quantified multiple transcripts, with the identity and functional state of each analyzed cell defined on the basis of the expression of a separate set of transcripts or proteins. By expanding high-throughput deep phenotyping of cells beyond protein epitopes to include RNA expression, PLAYR opens a new avenue for the characterization of cellular metabolism."

Most of these methods rely on the preparation, from solid tissues, of cell suspensions by enzymatic digestion, followed by analysis of single cell reactivity to an antibody panel that allows the discrimination of cell populations and characterization of their activation state. Thus for any specific biological problem, both efficient and at the same time mild, protocols for cell separation, together with tissue specific panels of antibodies, need to be developed and optimized. Here we characterize an antibody panel that permits the discrimination of mononuclear muscle cell populations by mass cytometry and use it to characterize the cell populations obtained by three different cell extraction procedures from muscle fibers. We show that our panel of antibodies, albeit limited and incomplete, is sufficient to discriminate most of the mononuclear muscle cell populations and that each cell extraction method yields heterogeneous cell populations with a different relative abundance of the distinct cell types."

We discovered that treating mice with an A-class CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) at 2 h after traumatic injury significantly improved mouse survival following early-onset secondary lung infection with S. pneumoniae. This study used mass cytometry (cytometry by time-of-flight) and Luminex technologies to characterize the cellular immune response to secondary S. pneumoniae lung infection at 1 and 3 d postinfection. We found increased expression of CD14, CD64, and PD-L1 on F4-80(+) and F4-80(+)CD11c(+) macrophages, CD11c(+) dendritic cells, and CD14(+)CD172a(+) cells after burn-injury and infection, supporting previous reports of innate immune cell activation in sepsis. CpG-ODN treatment at 2 h after burn-injury reversed these effects; improved pathogen clearance; and led to an increased expression of CD25, CD27, MHCII, and IL-17 on or in TCRγδ cells at 1 d postinfection. At 3 d postinfection, CpG-ODN treatment increased the expression of PD-L1 on innate cell subsets. Furthermore, we analyzed cytokine levels in lung-washout samples of TCRγδ cell-depleted (TCRγδ(-)) mice to demonstrate that the effects of CpG-ODN on cytokine expression after burn-injury and S. pneumoniae infection rely on functional TCRγδ cells. In summary, we demonstrate that cytometry by time-of-flight provides an effective strategy to systematically identify specific cellular phenotypic responses to trauma and bacterial pneumonia and to discover changes in immune system phenotypes associated with beneficial immunotherapy."

In this article, we present one-dimensional soli-expression by nonlinear stochastic embedding (One-SENSE), a dimensionality reduction method based on the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) algorithm, for categorical analysis of mass cytometry data. With One-SENSE, measured parameters are grouped into predefined categories, and cells are projected onto a space composed of one dimension for each category. In contrast with higher-dimensional t-SNE, each dimension (plot axis) in One-SENSE has biological meaning that can be easily annotated with binned heat plots. We applied One-SENSE to probe relationships between categories of human T cell phenotypes and observed previously unappreciated cellular populations within an orchestrated view of immune cell diversity. The presentation of high-dimensional cytometric data using One-SENSE showed a significant improvement in distinguished T cell diversity compared with the original t-SNE algorithm and could be useful for any high-dimensional dataset."

Here mass cytometry was directly compared with fluorescence cytometry by studying phenotypes of healthy human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in the context of superantigen stimulation. One mass cytometry panel and five fluorescence cytometry panels were used to measure 20 well-established lymphocyte markers of memory and activation. Comparable frequencies of both common and rare cell subpopulations were observed with fluorescence and mass cytometry using biaxial gating. The unsupervised high-dimensional analysis tool viSNE was then used to analyze data sets generated from both mass and fluorescence cytometry. viSNE analysis effectively characterized PBMC using eight features per cell and identified similar frequencies of activated CD4+ T cells with both technologies. These results suggest combinations of unsupervised analysis programs and extended multiparameter cytometry will be indispensable tools for detecting perturbations in protein expression in both health and disease.

The last decade has witnessed significant technical improvements in available cytometry platforms, such that more than 20 parameters can be analyzed on a single-cell level by fluorescence-based flow cytometry. The advent of mass cytometry has pushed this limit up to, currently, 50 parameters. However, traditional analysis approaches for the resulting high-dimensional datasets, such as gating on bivariate dot plots, have proven to be inefficient. Although a variety of novel computational analysis approaches to interpret these datasets are already available, they have not yet made it into the mainstream and remain largely unknown to many immunologists. Therefore, this review aims at providing a practical overview of novel analysis techniques for high-dimensional cytometry data including SPADE, t-SNE, Wanderlust, Citrus, and PhenoGraph, and how these applications can be used advantageously not only for the most complex datasets, but also for standard 14-parameter cytometry datasets."

However, probing signaling in epithelial tissues using cytometry-based single-cell analysis has been confounded by the necessity of single-cell dissociation, where disrupting cell-to-cell connections inherently perturbs native cell signaling states. Here, we demonstrate a novel strategy (Disaggregation for Intracellular Signaling in Single Epithelial Cells from Tissue-DISSECT) that preserves native signaling for Cytometry Time-of-Flight (CyTOF) and fluorescent flow cytometry applications. A 21-plex CyTOF analysis encompassing core signaling and cell-identity markers was performed on the small intestinal epithelium after systemic tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) stimulation. Unsupervised and supervised analyses robustly selected signaling features that identify a unique subset of epithelial cells that are sensitized to TNF-α-induced apoptosis in the seemingly homogeneous enterocyte population. Specifically, p-ERK and apoptosis are divergently regulated in neighboring enterocytes within the epithelium, suggesting a mechanism of contact-dependent survival. Our novel single-cell approach can broadly be applied, using both CyTOF and multi-parameter flow cytometry, for investigating normal and diseased cell states in a wide range of epithelial tissues."

In this study, we used cytometry by time-of-flight mass cytometry to better characterize the phenotypic response of T cell receptor γδ cells to Streptococcus pneumoniae lung infection. Mice were infected, and cells from lung washouts, spleen, and lymph nodes were stained to detect cell-surface, intracellular, and signaling markers. We observed that infection caused a significant increase in T cell receptor γδ cells, which expressed high interferon-γ and interleukin-17A levels. Profiling T cell receptor γδ cells by cytometry by time-of-flight revealed that activated γδ T cells uniquely coexpressed cell-surface Gr-1, cluster of differentiation 14, and cluster of differentiation 274 (programmed death-ligand 1). Further classification of Gr-1 expression patterns on T cell receptor γδ cells demonstrated that Gr-1(+) T cell receptor γδ cells were the primary source of interferon-γ, whereas Gr-1(-) cells mostly expressed interleukin-17A. Gr-1(+) T cell receptor γδ cells also showed higher ζ-chain-associated protein kinase 70, p38, and 4eBP1 signaling in response to infection as compared with Gr-1(-) T cell receptor γδ cells. Taken together, Gr-1 expression patterns on γδ T cells in the lung provide a robust marker to differentiate interferon-γ- and interleukin-17A-producing subsets involved in the early immune response to bacterial pneumonia."

For eight transplant recipients (four CMV negative and four CMV positive), we studied PBMCs obtained 6 mo after unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Forty cell-surface markers, distinguishing all major leukocyte populations in PBMC, were analyzed with mass cytometry. This group included 34 NK cell markers. Compared with healthy controls, transplant recipients had higher HLA-C expression on CD56(-)CD16(+) NK cells, B cells, CD33(bright) myeloid cells, and CD4CD8 T cells. The increase in HLA-C expression was greater for CMV-positive HCT recipients than for CMV negative recipients. Present in CMV-positive HCT recipients, but not in CMV-negative HCT recipients or controls, is a population of killer cell Ig-like receptor (KIR)-expressing CD8 T cells not previously described. These CD8 T cells coexpress CD56, CD57, and NKG2C. The HCT recipients also have a population of CD57(+)NKG2A(+) NK cells that preferentially express KIR2DL1. An inverse correlation was observed between the frequencies of CD57(+)NKG2C(+) NK cells and CD57(+)NKG2A(+) NK cells. Although CD57(+)NKG2A(+) NK cells are less abundant in CMV-positive recipients, their phenotype is of a more activated cell than the CD57(+)NKG2A(+) NK cells of controls and CMV-negative HCT recipients. These data demonstrate that HCT and CMV reactivation are associated with an increased expression of HLA-C. This could influence NK cell education during lymphocyte reconstitution. The increased inhibitory KIR expression by proliferating CMV-specific CD8 T cells suggests regulatory interactions between HLA-C and KIR might promote Graft-versus-Leukemia effects following transplantation."

Here we report a public-domain method for achieving high multiplicity single-cell IF using cyclic immunofluorescence (CycIF), a simple and versatile procedure in which four-colour staining alternates with chemical inactivation of fluorophores to progressively build a multichannel image. Because CycIF uses standard reagents and instrumentation and is no more expensive than conventional IF, it is suitable for high-throughput assays and screening applications."

However, the cellular proteome comprises many more potential analytes, and current mass cytometry instrumentation allows for theoretically up to 121 different mass detection channels. The labeling of specific probes with appropriate metal ions is a significant hurdle for exploiting more of mass cytometry's analytical capacity. To this end, we here describe the labeling of antibody with natural abundance or isotopically purified platinum as formulated in cisplatin and circumventing the use of chelator-loaded polymers. We confirm the utility of cisplatin-antibody-conjugates for surface, intracellular, and phosphoepitope-specific immunophenotyping, as well as for application in cell surface CD45-based barcoding. Cisplatin-labeling of antibody increases the analytical capacity of the CyTOF(®) platform by two channels based on available reagents, and has the potential to add a total of six channels for detection of specific probes, thus helping to better extend the analytical mass range of mass cytometers."

Many melanoma-associated T-cell epitopes have been described, but 45% of these are restricted to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2, leaving the remaining 36 different HLA molecules with only a few described T-cell epitopes each. Therefore we wanted to expand the number of T-cell epitopes restricted to HLA-A1, -A3, -A11 and -B7, all HLA molecules frequently expressed in Caucasians in Western Europe and Northern America. In Paper I we focused on the proteins gp100, Mart1, MAGE-A3, NY-ESO-1, tyrosinase and TRP-2, all melanoma-associated antigens frequently recognized by T cells from HLA-A2 patients. On contrary, in Paper II we wanted to investigate the protein Nodal as a novel immunological target. We took advantage of a T-cell epitope mapping platform in which HLA ligands are predicted by computer-based algorithms, further tested in the laboratory by an ELISA-based method and used for flow cytometry-based detection of specific T-cell responses by use of combinatorial encoded major histocompatibility (MHC) class I multimers. This procedure resulted in 127 (Paper I) and 32 (Paper II) confirmed HLA ligands, respectively, which we used for screening of the T-cell recognition within peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from melanoma patients. As spontaneous tumor-specific T-cell responses tend to be of very low frequency and probably below the detection threshold of the method, we incorporated a T-cell enrichment step prior to the detection of these responses. Our screening of 39 melanoma patients resulted in 26 (17 different) T-cell responses against the common melanoma-associated antigens and 10 (8 different) T-cell responses against Nodal. We were further able to show processing and presentation on the cell-surface in K562 and melanoma cells expressing relevant protein and HLA molecules of four of these peptide sequences from tyrosinase, gp100 (2 peptides) and Nodal, respectively. However, one of the gp100 peptides has previously been described as a T-cell epitope. In addition to identifying new melanoma-associated T-cell epitopes we could thus describe Nodal as a new immunological antigen found of relevance in melanoma patients. In Paper III we wanted to investigate if the hypomethylating drug 5-azactytidine (Vidaza, Celgene Inc.) modulates the immune system in patients with myeloproliferative diseases. It has previ-ously been shown that 5-azacytidine-mediated demethylation of gene promoter regions results in enhanced transcription and expression of tumor suppressor genes and cancer-testis antigens. Cancer-testis antigens have frequently been recognized by T-cells in many cancers, and we hypothesized that 5-azacytidine treat-ment in the clinic would increase their frequency with resulting enhanced anti-tumor reactivity. We investigated separately the effect on T cells and tumor cells, and found that tumor cells af-fected by the treatment were better recognized, resulting in higher numbers of activated T cells, than tumor cells not exposed to 5-azacytidine. No effects were observed on the T-cell population. A screen of the T-cell recognition of 43 cancer-testis antigens in blood from our patients revealed increased T-cell recognition upon start of therapy which, though, stabilized or declined at later time points. We further investigated the general immune effector and inhibitory cell populations and found only minor effects of drug exposure, suggesting that 5-azacytidine primarily affects the tumor cells. From these results we are currently initiating a phase I clinical trial of cancer-testis antigen-peptide vaccination in combination with 5-azacytidine therapy for patients with myeloproliferative diseases. In Paper IV we wanted to expand the library of conditional ligands for use with the UV light-mediated peptide-exchange method. This method enables high-throughput generation of MHC class I molecules with different peptide-specificities. These MHC monomers can be multimerized and used for detection of specific T cell populations by flow or mass cytometry. The HLA molecules are highly genetically variable and this necessitates unique design of conditional ligands for each HLA molecule. Thus, to screen for the T-cell recognition in a given setting within all patients or healthy donors present in a cohort, a broad library of conditional ligands is needed. We designed and evaluated conditional ligands for HLA-B*08:01, HLA-B*35:01 and HLA-B*44:02/03/05, all HLA-B molecules present in high frequency among Caucasians. In addition, we provided proof for the use of a conditional ligand first designed for HLA-B*15:02 in complex with HLA-B*15:01. We compared the staining patterns of HLA-B*15:01 and HLA-B*15:02 MHC multimers and found remarkable dissimilarities, although the two heavy chains in these MHC molecules only differ in a few amino acid positions."

We used CyTOF to evaluate T cells infected with varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection, documenting virus-mediated phenotypic and functional changes caused by this T cell tropic human herpesvirus. Here we summarize our findings using two complementary panels of antibodies against surface and intracellular signaling proteins to elucidate the consequences of VZV-mediated perturbations on the surface and in signaling networks of infected T cells. CyTOF data was analyzed by several statistical, analytical and visualization tools including hierarchical clustering, orthogonal scaling, SPADE, viSNE, and SLIDE. Data from the mass cytometry studies demonstrated that VZV infection led to 'remodeling' of the surface architecture of T cells, promoting skin trafficking phenotypes and associated with concomitant activation of T-cell receptor and PI3-kinase pathways. This method offers a novel approach for understanding viral interactions with differentiated host cells important for pathogenesis."

Epub 2015 Jul 17.,Keywords: CyTOF; TLR4; clinical applications; innate immunity; mass cytometry; monocytes; preterm birth; single cell.,"Single-cell technologies have immense potential to shed light on molecular and biological processes that drive human diseases. Mass cytometry (or Cytometry by Time Of Flight mass spectrometry, CyTOF) has already been employed in clinical studies to comprehensively survey patients' circulating immune system. As interest in the ""bedside"" application of mass cytometry is growing, the delineation of relevant methodological issues is called for. This report uses a newly generated dataset to discuss important methodological considerations when mass cytometry is implemented in a clinical study. Specifically, the use of whole blood samples versus peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), design of mass-tagged antibody panels, technical and analytical implications of sample barcoding, and application of traditional and unsupervised approaches to analyze high-dimensional mass cytometry datasets are discussed. A mass cytometry assay was implemented in a cross-sectional study of 19 women with a history of term or preterm birth to determine whether immune traits in peripheral blood differentiate the two groups in the absence of pregnancy. Twenty-seven phenotypic and 11 intracellular markers were simultaneously analyzed in whole blood samples stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS at 0, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 ng mL(-1)) to examine dose-dependent signaling responses within the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway. Complementary analyses, grounded in traditional or unsupervised gating strategies of immune cell subsets, indicated that the prpS6 and pMAPKAPK2 responses in classical monocytes are accentuated in women with a history of preterm birth (FDR<1%). The results suggest that women predisposed to preterm birth may be prone to mount an exacerbated TLR4 response during the course of pregnancy. This important hypothesis-generating finding points to the power of single-cell mass cytometry to detect biologically important differences in a relatively small patient cohort."

Conventional data analysis by manual gating of cells in biaxial dot plots is often subjective, time consuming, and neglectful of much of the information contained in a highly dimensional cytometric dataset. Algorithmic data mining has the promise to eliminate these concerns, and several such tools have been applied recently to mass cytometry data.

In this study, we used phospho-specific flow cytometry and high-dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) to compare BCR signaling responses in mature human tonsillar B cells undergoing germinal center (GC) reactions. GC B cells, in contrast to mature naive B cells, memory B cells, and plasmablasts, were hypersensitive to a range of H2O2 concentrations and responded by phosphorylating SYK and other membrane-proximal BCR effectors in the absence of BCR engagement. These findings reveal that stage-specific redox responses distinguish human GC B cells."

The power of multiplexing combined with spatial information and quantification was recently illustrated on breast cancer tissue and was described as next-generation IHC. Robust, accurate, and high-throughput cell segmentation is crucial for the analysis of this new generation of IHC data. To this end, we propose a watershed-based cell segmentation, which uses a nuclear marker and multiple membrane markers, the latter automatically selected based on their correlation. In comparison with the state-of-the-art segmentation pipelines, which are only using a single marker for object detection, we could show that the use of multiple markers can significantly increase the segmentation power, and thus, multiplexed information should be used and not ignored during the segmentation. Furthermore, we provide a novel, user-friendly open-source toolbox for the automatic segmentation of multiplexed histopathological images."

However, improved knowledge of the lineage-specific consequences of telomere erosion and restoration of telomere length in hematopoietic progenitors is required to advance therapeutic approaches. We have employed a reversible murine model of telomerase deficiency to compare the dependence of erythroid and myeloid lineage differentiation on telomerase activity. Fifth generation Tert-/- (G5 Tert-/-) mice with shortened telomeres have significant anemia, decreased erythroblasts and reduced hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) populations associated with neutrophilia and increased myelopoiesis. Intracellular multiparameter analysis by mass cytometry showed significantly reduced cell proliferation and increased sensitivity to activation of DNA damage checkpoints in erythroid progenitors and in erythroid-biased CD150hi HSC, but not in myeloid progenitors. Strikingly, Cre-inducible reactivation of telomerase activity restored hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) proliferation, normalized the DNA damage response, and improved red cell production and hemoglobin levels. These data establish a direct link between the loss of TERT activity, telomere shortening and defective erythropoiesis and suggest that novel strategies to restore telomerase function may have an important role in the treatment of the resulting anemia."

We have devised a novel approach to describing modes using second order polynomial histogram estimators (SOPHE). The method divides the data into multivariate bins and determines the shape of the data in each bin based on second order polynomials, which is an efficient computation. These calculations yield local maxima and allow joining of adjacent bins to identify clusters. The use of second order polynomials also optimally uses wide bins, such that in most cases each parameter (dimension) need only be divided into 4-8 bins, again reducing computational load. We have validated this method using defined mixtures of up to 17 fluorescent beads in 16 dimensions, correctly identifying all populations in data files of 100,000 beads in <10 s, on a standard laptop. The method also correctly clustered granulocytes, lymphocytes, including standard T, B, and NK cell subsets, and monocytes in 9-color stained peripheral blood, within seconds. SOPHE successfully clustered up to 36 subsets of memory CD4 T cells using differentiation and trafficking markers, in 14-color flow analysis, and up to 65 subpopulations of PBMC in 33-dimensional CyTOF data, showing its usefulness in discovery research. SOPHE has the potential to greatly increase efficiency of analysing complex mixtures of cells in higher dimensions."

Although the phenotypic and functional analysis of immune cells is an appealing strategy for understanding immune-mediated disease processes, immune cell profiling currently has no role in clinical rheumatology. New technologies, including mass cytometry, gene expression profiling by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and multiplexed functional assays, enable the analysis of immune cell function with unprecedented detail and promise not only a deeper understanding of pathogenesis, but also the discovery of novel biomarkers. The large and complex data sets generated by these technologies--big data--require specialized approaches for analysis and visualization of results. Standardization of assays and definition of the range of normal values are additional challenges when translating these novel approaches into clinical practice. In this Review, we discuss technological advances in the high-dimensional analysis of immune cells and consider how these developments might support the discovery of predictive biomarkers to benefit the practice of rheumatology and improve patient care."

We investigated S. Typhi-specific modulation of activation and homing potential of circulating regulatory T cells (Treg) by flow and mass cytometry using specimens obtained from a human challenge study. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from volunteers pre- and at multiple time-points post-challenge with wild-type S. Typhi. We identified differing patterns of S. Typhi-specific modulation of the homing potential of circulating Treg between volunteers diagnosed with typhoid (TD) and those who were not (No TD). TD volunteers demonstrated up-regulation of the gut homing molecule integrin α4ß7 pre-challenge, followed by a significant down-regulation post-challenge consistent with Treg homing to the gut. Additionally, S. Typhi-specific Treg from TD volunteers exhibited up-regulation of activation molecules post-challenge (e.g., HLA-DR, LFA-1). We further demonstrate that depletion of Treg results in increased S. Typhi-specific cytokine production by CD8+ TEM in vitro. These results suggest that the tissue distribution of activated Treg, their characteristics and activation status may play a pivotal role in typhoid fever, possibly through suppression of S. Typhi-specific effector T cell responses. These studies provide important novel insights into the regulation of immune responses that are likely to be critical in protection against typhoid and other enteric infectious diseases."

Until recently, immune responses were dissected by use of global approaches and bulk tools, averaging responses across samples and potentially missing particular contributions of individual cells. This is a strongly limiting factor, considering that initial immune responses are likely to be triggered by a restricted number of cells at the vanguard of host defenses. The development of novel, single-cell technologies is a major innovation offering great promise for basic and translational immunology with the potential to overcome some of the limitations of traditional research tools, such as polychromatic flow cytometry or microscopy-based methods. At the transcriptional level, much progress has been made in the fields of microfluidics and single-cell RNA sequencing. At the protein level, mass cytometry already allows the analysis of twice as many parameters as flow cytometry. In this review, we explore the basis and outcome of immune-cell diversity, how genetically identical cells become functionally different, and the consequences for the exploration of host-immune defense responses. We will highlight the advantages, trade-offs, and potential pitfalls of emerging, single-cell-based technologies and how they provide unprecedented detail of immune responses."

Epub 2015 Apr 7.,Keywords: Key terms: automated multivariate clustering; iterative model-based clustering; probability based metaclustering; rare population detection.,"Multiparametric fluorescence and mass cytometry offers new perspectives to disclose and to monitor the high diversity of cell populations in the peripheral blood for biomarker research. While high-end cytometric devices are currently available to detect theoretically up to 120 individual parameters at the single cell level, software tools are needed to analyze these complex datasets automatically in acceptable time and without operator bias or knowledge. We developed an automated analysis pipeline, immunoClust, for uncompensated fluorescence and mass cytometry data, which consists of two parts. First, cell events of each sample are grouped into individual clusters. Subsequently, a classification algorithm assorts these cell event clusters into populations comparable between different samples. The clustering of cell events is designed for datasets with large event counts in high dimensions as a global unsupervised method, sensitive to identify rare cell types even when next to large populations. Both parts use model-based clustering with an iterative expectation maximization algorithm and the integrated classification likelihood to obtain the clusters. A detailed description of both algorithms is presented. Testing and validation was performed using 1) blood cell samples of defined composition that were depleted of particular cell subsets by magnetic cell sorting, 2) datasets of the FlowCAP III challenges to identify populations of rare cell types and 3) high-dimensional fluorescence and mass-cytometry datasets for comparison with conventional manual gating procedures. In conclusion, the immunoClust-algorithm is a promising tool to standardize and automate the analysis of high-dimensional cytometric datasets. As a prerequisite for interpretation of such data, it will support our efforts in developing immunological biomarkers for chronic inflammatory disorders and therapy recommendations in personalized medicine. immunoClust is implemented as an R-package and is provided as source code from www.bioconductor.org."

Medical therapies are linked to the BCL-2 family-mediated apoptosis. Imbalance in BCL-2 family proteins may cause failure in therapeutic responses. We investigated the role of BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-737 for lymphocyte apoptosis in mice under inflammatory conditions. B.6129P2-interleukin (IL)-10(tm1Cgn) /J (IL-10(-/-) ) weighing 25-30 g with ongoing colitis were used. Fifty mg/kg/day ABT-737 was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.). Haematological analyses were performed with an ADVIA 2120 flow cytometer and mass cytometry with a CyTOF 2. Following i.p. administration, ABT-737 was detected in both spontaneous and acute colitis in peripheral blood (PBL) and colon tissue. Treatment led to lymphopenia. CD4(+) CD44(+) CD62L(+) central memory and CD8(+) , CD44(+) CD62L(-) central memory T cells were decreased in PBL upon ABT-737 compared to vehicle-receiving controls. Increased apoptosis upon ABT-737 was determined in blood lymphocytes, splenocytes and Peyer's patches and was accompanied by a decrease in TNF and IL-1B. ABT-737 positively altered the colonic mucosa and ameliorated inflammation, as shown by colonoscopy, histology and colon length. A decreased BIM/BCL-2 ratio or absence of BIM in both Bim(-) (/) (-) and Il10(-) (/) (-) × Bim(-) (/) (-) impeded the protective effect of ABT-737. The BIM/BCL-2 ratio decreased with age and during the course of treatment. Thus, long-term treatment resulted in adapted TNF levels and macroscopic mucosal damage. ABT-737 was efficacious in diminishing lymphocytes and ameliorating colitis in a BIM-dependent manner. Regulation of inappropriate survival of lymphocytes by ABT-737 may provide a therapeutic strategy in IBD."

Epub 2015 Apr 1.,Article has no keywords,"In the context of most induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell reprogramming methods, heterogeneous populations of non-productive and staggered productive intermediates arise at different reprogramming time points. Despite recent reports claiming substantially increased reprogramming efficiencies using genetically modified donor cells, prospectively isolating distinct reprogramming intermediates remains an important goal to decipher reprogramming mechanisms. Previous attempts to identify surface markers of intermediate cell populations were based on the assumption that, during reprogramming, cells progressively lose donor cell identity and gradually acquire iPS cell properties. Here we report that iPS cell and epithelial markers, such as SSEA1 and EpCAM, respectively, are not predictive of reprogramming during early phases. Instead, in a systematic functional surface marker screen, we find that early reprogramming-prone cells express a unique set of surface markers, including CD73, CD49d and CD200, that are absent in both fibroblasts and iPS cells. Single-cell mass cytometry and prospective isolation show that these distinct intermediates are transient and bridge the gap between donor cell silencing and pluripotency marker acquisition during the early, presumably stochastic, reprogramming phase. Expression profiling reveals early upregulation of the transcriptional regulators Nr0b1 and Etv5 in this reprogramming state, preceding activation of key pluripotency regulators such as Rex1 (also known as Zfp42), Dppa2, Nanog and Sox2. Both factors are required for the generation of the early intermediate state and fully reprogrammed iPS cells, and thus represent some of the earliest known regulators of iPS cell induction. Our study deconvolutes the first steps in a hierarchical series of events that lead to pluripotency acquisition."

Analysis of peripheral blood samples from 13 cancer patients, 9 precancer patients, and 9 healthy individuals revealed significant differences in the frequencies of the T-cell, B-cell, and natural killer-cell compartments. Most strikingly, we identified a novel B-cell population that normally accounts for 4.0% ± 0.7% (mean ± SD) of total B cells and is up to 13-fold expanded in multiple myeloma patients with active disease. This population expressed markers previously associated with both memory (CD27(+)) and naïve (CD24(lo)CD38(+)) phenotypes. Single-cell immunoglobulin gene sequencing showed polyclonality, indicating that these cells are not precursors to the myeloma, and somatic mutations, a characteristic of memory cells. SYK, ERK, and p38 phosphorylation responses, and the fact that most of these cells expressed isotypes other than IgM or IgD, confirmed the memory character of this population, defining it as a novel type of memory B cells."

However, the full potential of using CyTOF can be limited by scarce cell samples. Barcoding strategies developed based on direct labeling of cells using maleimido-monoamide-DOTA (m-DOTA) provide a very useful tool. However, using m-DOTA has some inherent problems, mainly associated with signal intensity. This may be a source of uncertainty when samples are multiplexed. As an alternative or complementary approach to m-DOTA, conjugating an antibody, specific for a membrane protein present on most immune cells, with different isotopes could address the issues of stability and signal intensity needed for effective barcoding. We chose for this purpose CD45, and designed experiments to address different types of cultures and the ability to detect extra- and intra-cellular targets. We show here that our approach provides an useful alternative to m-DOTA in terms of sensitivity, specificity, flexibility, and user-friendliness.

The approach greatly reduced technical noise and minimizes unwanted cell doublet events in mass cytometry data, and it reduces wet work and Ab consumption. It also eliminates sample-to-sample carryover and the requirement of instrument cleaning between samples, thereby effectively reducing overall instrument runtime. Hence, CD45 barcoding facilitates accuracy of mass cytometric immunophenotyping studies, thus supporting biomarker discovery efforts, and it should be applicable to fluorescence flow cytometry as well."

Current work on AML LSCs is limited by the number of parameters that conventional flow cytometry (FCM) can analyze because of cell autofluorescence and fluorescent dye spectral overlap. Single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) substitutes rare earth elements for fluorophores to label antibodies, which allows measurements of up to 120 parameters in single cells without correction for spectral overlap. The aim of this study was the evaluation of intracellular signaling in antigen-defined stem/progenitor cell subsets in primary AML. CyTOF and conventional FCM yielded comparable results on LSC phenotypes defined by CD45, CD34, CD38, CD123, and CD99. Intracellular phosphoprotein responses to ex vivo cell signaling inhibitors and cytokine stimulation were assessed in myeloid leukemia cell lines and one primary AML sample. CyTOF and conventional FCM results were confirmed by western blotting. In the primary AML sample, we investigated the cell responses to ex vivo stimulation with stem cell factor and BEZ235-induced inhibition of PI3K and identified activation patterns in multiple PI3K downstream signaling pathways including p-4EBP1, p-AKT, and p-S6, particularly in CD34(+) subsets. We evaluated multiple signaling pathways in antigen-defined subpopulations in primary AML cells with FLT3-ITD mutations. The data demonstrated the heterogeneity of cell phenotype distribution and distinct patterns of signaling activation across AML samples and between AML and normal samples. The mTOR targets p-4EBP1 and p-S6 were exclusively found in FLT3-ITD stem/progenitor cells, but not in their normal counterparts, suggesting both as novel targets in FLT3 mutated AML. Our data suggest that CyTOF can identify functional signaling pathways in antigen-defined subpopulations in primary AML, which may provide a rationale for designing therapeutics targeting LSC-enriched cell populations."

However, the biomarker CD4 protein expression level measured for T helper cells from Cyto-Trol was about 16% lower than those for cryopreserved PBMC and fresh whole blood using flow cytometry and mass cytometry. A primary reason was hypothesized to be due to steric interference in anti- CD4 antibody binding to the smaller sized lyophilized control cells."

The output data are in the format as .txt and .fcs files, which is compatible with many analysis programs. This protocol could be adapted to include tetramers into the staining panel, but we have not optimized for that purpose. The principal steps of intracellular cytokine staining are as follows: First, cells are activated for a few hours using either a specific peptide or a non-specific activation cocktail. An inhibitor of protein transport (e.g. Brefeldin A) is added to retain the cytokines within the cell. Next, EDTA is added to remove adherent cells from the activation vessel. After washing, antibodies to cell surface markers are added to the cells. The cells are then fixed in paraformaldehyde and permeabilized. We use a gentle detergent, saponin, as the permealization buffer because it is less destructive to surface and intracellular epitopes compared to harsh detergents or methanol. After permeabilization, the metal-conjugated anti-cytokine antibodies are added into the cell suspension. The stained cells are then sequentially introduced into the mass cytometry for signal intensity analysis."

In order for a cell to be seen, a metal in the mass window must be present; there is no analogous parameter to forward or side scatter. The current mass window selected is approximately AW 103-196, which includes the lanthanides used for most antibody labeling, as well as iridium and rhodium for DNA intercalators. In this protocol, we use a cocktail of antibodies labeled with MAXPAR metal-chelating polymers to surface-stain live PBMC that have been previously cryopreserved.

A thorough description and quantification of maladaptive signaling flux in disease is a critical step in drug development, and complex proteomic approaches can provide valuable mechanistic insights. Traditional proteomics-based signaling analyses rely heavily on in vitro cellular monoculture. The characterization of these simplified systems generates a rich understanding of the basic components and complex interactions of many signaling networks, but they cannot capture the full complexity of the microenvironments in which pathologies are ultimately made manifest. Unfortunately, techniques that can directly interrogate signaling in situ often yield mass-limited starting materials that are incompatible with traditional proteomics workflows. This review provides an overview of established and emerging techniques that are applicable to context-dependent proteomics. Analytical approaches are illustrated through recent proteomics-based studies in which selective sample acquisition strategies preserve context-dependent information, and where the challenge of minimal starting material is met by optimized sensitivity and coverage. This review is organized into three major technological themes: (i) LC methods in line with MS; (ii) antibody-based approaches; (iii) MS imaging with a discussion of data integration and systems modeling. Finally, we conclude with future perspectives and implications of context-dependent proteomics."

The analysis identified a conserved CD161++/MAIT cell transcriptional signature enriched in CD161+CD8+ T cells, which can be extended to CD161+ CD4+ and CD161+TCRγδ+ T cells. Furthermore, this led to the identification of a shared innate-like, TCR-independent response to interleukin (IL)-12 plus IL-18 by different CD161-expressing T cell populations. This response was independent of regulation by CD161, which acted as a costimulatory molecule in the context of T cell receptor stimulation. Expression of CD161 hence identifies a transcriptional and functional phenotype, shared across human T lymphocytes and independent of both T cell receptor (TCR) expression and cell lineage."

In this first-in-man study, we have induced antiviral immunity with functional characteristics analogous to those associated with viral control in natural infection, and improved upon a vaccine based on adenoviral vectors alone. We assessed a heterologous prime-boost vaccination strategy based on a replicative defective simian adenoviral vector (ChAd3) and modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vector encoding the NS3, NS4, NS5A, and NS5B proteins of HCV genotype 1b. Analysis used single-cell mass cytometry and human leukocyte antigen class I peptide tetramer technology in healthy human volunteers. We show that HCV-specific T cells induced by ChAd3 are optimally boosted with MVA, and generate very high levels of both CD8(+) and CD4(+) HCV-specific T cells targeting multiple HCV antigens. Sustained memory and effector T cell populations are generated, and T cell memory evolved over time with improvement of quality (proliferation and polyfunctionality) after heterologous MVA boost.

Using mass cytometry, a high-dimensional technique that can probe multiple signaling nodes at the single-cell level, we interrogate TCR signaling dynamics in control C57BL/6 and autoimmunity-prone nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, which show ineffective ERK activation after TCR triggering. By quantitating signals at multiple steps along the signaling cascade and parsing the phosphorylation level of each node as a function of its predecessors, we show that a small impairment in initial pCD3ζ activation resonates farther down the signaling cascade and results in larger defects in activation of the ERK1/2-S6 and IκBα modules. This nonlinear property of TCR signaling networks, which magnifies small initial differences during signal propagation, also applies in cells from B6 mice activated at different levels of intensity. Impairment in pCD3ζ and pSLP76 is not a feedback consequence of a primary deficiency in ERK activation because no proximal signaling defect was observed in Erk2 KO T cells. These defects, which were manifest at all stages of T-cell differentiation from early thymic pre-T cells to memory T cells, may condition the imbalanced immunoregulation and tolerance in NOD T cells. More generally, this amplification of small initial differences in signal intensity may explain how T cells discriminate between closely related ligands and adopt strongly delineated cell fates."

However, the challenge of developing and applying computational approaches to interpret such complex data remains. Here, we developed computational methods, based on established statistical concepts, to characterize signaling network relationships by quantifying the strengths of network edges and deriving signaling response functions. In comparing signaling between naïve and antigen-exposed CD4(+) T lymphocytes, we find that although these two cell subtypes had similarly wired networks, naïve cells transmitted more information along a key signaling cascade than did antigen-exposed cells. We validated our characterization on mice lacking the extracellular-regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK2, which showed stronger influence of pERK on pS6 (phosphorylated-ribosomal protein S6), in naïve cells as compared with antigen-exposed cells, as predicted.

Using mass cytometry, we found that NKR expression patterns distinguish cell lineages in human peripheral blood. In individuals with high levels of CD57, indicative of a mature immune repertoire, NKRs are more likely to be expressed on non-NK cells, especially CD8(+) T cells. Mature NK and CD8(+) T cell populations show increased diversity of NKR surface expression patterns, but with distinct determinants: mature NK cells acquire primarily inhibitory receptors, whereas CD8(+) T cells attain a specific subset of both activating and inhibitory receptors, potentially imbuing them with a distinct functional role. Concurrently, monocytes show decreased expression of the generalized inhibitory receptor leukocyte Ig-like receptor subfamily b member 1, consistent with an increased activation threshold. Therefore, NKR expression is coordinately regulated as the immune system matures, resulting in the transfer of ""altered self"" recognition potential among leukocyte lineages. This likely reduces Ag specificity in the mature human immune system, and implies that vaccines and therapeutics that engage both its innate and adaptive branches may be more effective in the settings of aging and chronic infection."

Epub 2014 Sep 6.,Keywords: Fcγ receptors; Immunology; Influenza; Mass cytometry; Vaccine.,"Seasonal influenza vaccination is one of the most common medical procedures and yet the extent to which it activates the immune system beyond inducing antibody production is not well understood. In the United States, the most prevalent formulations of the vaccine consist of degraded or ""split"" viral particles distributed without any adjuvants. Based on previous reports we sought to determine whether the split influenza vaccine activates innate immune receptors-specifically Toll-like receptors. High-dimensional proteomic profiling of human whole-blood using Cytometry by Time-of-Flight (CyTOF) was used to compare signaling pathway activation and cytokine production between the split influenza vaccine and a prototypical TLR response ex vivo. This analysis revealed that the split vaccine rapidly and potently activates multiple immune cell types but yields a proteomic signature quite distinct from TLR activation. Importantly, vaccine induced activity was dependent upon the presence of human sera indicating that a serum factor was necessary for vaccine-dependent immune activation. We found this serum factor to be human antibodies specific for influenza proteins and therefore immediate immune activation by the split vaccine is immune-complex dependent. These studies demonstrate that influenza virus ""splitting"" inactivates any potential adjuvants endogenous to influenza, such as RNA, but in previously exposed individuals can elicit a potent immune response by facilitating the rapid formation of immune complexes."

Current reagents compatible with MC analysis employ antibody-metal-chelating polymer conjugates to report on the presence of biomarkers. Here, we expand the utility of MC by developing the first activity-based probe designed specifically for use with the technology. A compact MC-detectable telluroether is linked to a bioreductively sensitive 2-nitroimidazole scaffold, thereby generating a probe sensitive to cellular hypoxia. The probe exhibits low toxicity and is able to selectively label O2-deprived cells. A proof-of-concept experiment employing metal-bound DNA intercalators demonstrates that a heterogeneous mixture of cells with differential exposure to O2 can be effectively discriminated by the quantity of tellurium-labeling. The organotellurium reagents described herein provide a general approach to the development of a large toolkit of MC-compatible probes for activity-based profiling of single cells."

Most of the information is presented with a minimum amount of published data and much is based on discussions with users and the vendor, to help provide the reader with an unbiased assessment of where the subteam sees each technology fitting best in the bioanalysis of large molecules. The evaluation focuses on technologies with advantages in throughput and multiplexing, but is wide enough to capture their strengths in other areas. While all platforms may be suited to support bioanalysis in the discovery space, because of their emergent nature, only Optimiser and SQIDLite are currently ready to be used in the regulated space. With the exception of Optimiser, each instrument/technology requires an up-front investment from the bioanalytical lab that will need justification during capital budget discussions. Ultimately, the platform choice should be driven by the quality of data, project needs, and the intended use of the data generated. In a time- and resource-constrained environment, it is not possible to evaluate all emergent technologies available in the market; we hope that this review gives the reader some of the information needed to decide which technology he/she may want to consider evaluating to support their drug development program in comparison to the options they already have in their hands."

Technological advances in cytometry instrumentation are increasing the size and dimensionality of data sets, posing a challenge for traditional data management and analysis. Automated analysis methods, despite a general consensus of their importance to the future of the field, have been slow to gain widespread adoption. Here we present OpenCyto, a new BioConductor infrastructure and data analysis framework designed to lower the barrier of entry to automated flow data analysis algorithms by addressing key areas that we believe have held back wider adoption of automated approaches. OpenCyto supports end-to-end data analysis that is robust and reproducible while generating results that are easy to interpret. We have improved the existing, widely used core BioConductor flow cytometry infrastructure by allowing analysis to scale in a memory efficient manner to the large flow data sets that arise in clinical trials, and integrating domain-specific knowledge as part of the pipeline through the hierarchical relationships among cell populations. Pipelines are defined through a text-based csv file, limiting the need to write data-specific code, and are data agnostic to simplify repetitive analysis for core facilities. We demonstrate how to analyze two large cytometry data sets: an intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) data set from a published HIV vaccine trial focused on detecting rare, antigen-specific T-cell populations, where we identify a new subset of CD8 T-cells with a vaccine-regimen specific response that could not be identified through manual analysis, and a CyTOF T-cell phenotyping data set where a large staining panel and many cell populations are a challenge for traditional analysis. The substantial improvements to the core BioConductor flow cytometry packages give OpenCyto the potential for wide adoption. It can rapidly leverage new developments in computational cytometry and facilitate reproducible analysis in a unified environment."

Contrary to the premise that VZV selectively infects T cells with skin trafficking profiles, VZV infection altered T cell surface proteins to enhance or induce these properties.

Pt levels of 10(5) to 10(6) atoms/cell were obtained following a single cisplatin treatment using clinically relevant doses. Cisplatin caused cell cycle arrest in a dose- and time-dependent manner that paralleled effects in vitro, and it readily penetrated into hypoxic tumor regions. Similar levels of Pt/cell were found in xenografts treated with oxaliplatin.

Despite recent advancements in single-cell measurement technologies, the identification of relevant cell subsets through manual efforts remains standard practice. As new technologies such as mass cytometry increase the parameterization of single-cell measurements, the scalability and subjectivity inherent in manual analyses slows both analysis and progress. We therefore developed Citrus (cluster identification, characterization, and regression), a data-driven approach for the identification of stratifying subpopulations in multidimensional cytometry datasets. The methodology of Citrus is demonstrated through the identification of known and unexpected pathway responses in a dataset of stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells measured by mass cytometry. Additionally, the performance of Citrus is compared with that of existing methods through the analysis of several publicly available datasets. As the complexity of flow cytometry datasets continues to increase, methods such as Citrus will be needed to aid investigators in the performance of unbiased--and potentially more thorough--correlation-based mining and inspection of cell subsets nested within high-dimensional datasets."

High-dimensional techniques like mass cytometry enable multiplexed single-cell analysis of cell identity, clinical biomarkers, signaling network phospho-proteins, transcription factors, and functional readouts of proliferation, cell cycle status, and apoptosis. This capability pairs well with a signaling profiles approach that dissects mechanism by systematically perturbing and measuring many nodes in a signaling network.

To avoid many of the complications of experiments on live or fixed cells, we carried out proof-of-concept experiments using aqueous microgels with a diameter on the order of 700 nm as a proxy for cells. These microgels were used to test whether nanoparticle (NP) reagents would allow the detection of as few as 100 proteins per ""cell"" in cell-by-cell assays. Streptavidin (SAv), which served as the model biomarker, was attached to the microgel in two different ways. Covalent coupling to surface carboxyls of the microgel led to large numbers (>10(4)) of proteins per microgel, whereas biotinylation of the microgel followed by exposure to SAv led to much smaller numbers of SAv per microgel. Using mass cytometry, we compared two biotin-containing reagents, which recognized and bound to the SAvs on the microgel. One was a metal chelating polymer (MCP), a biotin end-capped polyaspartamide containing 50 Tb(3+) ions per probe. The other was a biotinylated NaHoF4 NP containing 15 000 Ho atoms per probe. Nonspecific binding was determined with bovine serum albumin (BSA) conjugated microgels. The MCP was effective at detecting and quantifying SAvs on the microgel with covalently bound SAv (20 000 SAvs per microgel) but was unable to give a meaningful signal above that of the BSA-coated microgel for the samples with low levels of SAv. Here the NP reagent gave a signal 2 orders of magnitude stronger than that of the MCP and allowed detection of NPs ranging from 100 to 500 per microgel. Sensitivity was limited by the level of nonspecific adsorption. This proof of concept experiment demonstrates the enhanced sensitivity possible with NP reagents in cell-by-cell assays by mass cytometry."

Using multiparametric phospho-flow and mass cytometry, we measured the intracellular phosphorylation-dependent signaling events at a single-cell resolution and studied the phosphorylation levels of key proximal human TCR activation- and inhibition-signaling molecules. We show that the intracellular balance and signal integration between these opposing signaling cascades serve as the molecular switch gauging Ag dose. An Ag density of 100 peptide-MHC complexes/cell was found to be the transition point between dominant activation and inhibition cascades, whereas higher Ag doses induced an anergic functional state. Finally, the neutralization of key inhibitory molecules reversed T cell unresponsiveness and enabled maximal T cell functions, even in the presence of very high Ag doses. This mechanism permits T cells to make integrated ""measurements"" of Ag dose that determine subsequent functional outcomes."

Type I and type II NKT cell subsets recognize different lipid antigens presented by CD1d, an MHC class-I-like molecule. Most type I NKT cells express a semi-invariant T-cell receptor (TCR), but a major subset of type II NKT cells reactive to a self antigen sulphatide use an oligoclonal TCR. Whereas TCR-α dominates CD1d-lipid recognition by type I NKT cells, TCR-α and TCR-β contribute equally to CD1d-lipid recognition by type II NKT cells. These variable modes of NKT cell recognition of lipid-CD1d complexes activate a host of cytokine-dependent responses that can either exacerbate or protect from disease. Recent studies of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases have led to a hypothesis that: (i) although type I NKT cells can promote pathogenic and regulatory responses, they are more frequently pathogenic, and (ii) type II NKT cells are predominantly inhibitory and protective from such responses and diseases. This review focuses on a further test of this hypothesis by the use of recently developed techniques, intravital imaging and mass cytometry, to analyse the molecular and cellular dynamics of type I and type II NKT cell antigen-presenting cell motility, interaction, activation and immunoregulation that promote immune responses leading to health versus disease outcomes."

To more quickly determine how these different modes or modulations of presentation translate into altered immune responses, higher throughput methods for identifying T cell epitopes are needed. Proteomics-based comprehensive cataloging of peptides eluted from MHC is a challenging but ideal way of identifying peptide sequences influenced by variable modes of processing and presentation. Several groups have already been successful with this approach and ongoing technical improvements will broaden its applicability. Subsequently, high content combinatorial peptide-MHC tetramer staining using mass cytometry, as we have recently described, should enable the broad assessment of how these changes are perceived by T cells and translated into an altered immune response. The importance of this analysis is highlighted by evidence that physiologically relevant variation in antigen processing and presentation as well as other factors can give rise to unpredictably different T cell responses."

Clustering cells based on phenotypic similarity comes at a loss of single-cell resolution and often the number of subpopulations is unknown a priori. Here we describe ACCENSE, a tool that combines nonlinear dimensionality reduction with density-based partitioning, and displays multivariate cellular phenotypes on a 2D plot. We apply ACCENSE to 35-parameter mass cytometry data from CD8(+) T cells derived from specific pathogen-free and germ-free mice, and stratify cells into phenotypic subpopulations. Our results show significant heterogeneity within the known CD8(+) T-cell subpopulations, and of particular note is that we find a large novel subpopulation in both specific pathogen-free and germ-free mice that has not been described previously. This subpopulation possesses a phenotypic signature that is distinct from conventional naive and memory subpopulations when analyzed by ACCENSE, but is not distinguishable on a biaxial plot of standard markers. We are able to automatically identify cellular subpopulations based on all proteins analyzed, thus aiding the full utilization of powerful new single-cell technologies such as mass cytometry."

Because their activation is controlled by a variety of combinatorially expressed activating and inhibitory receptors, NK cell diversity and function are closely linked. To provide an unprecedented understanding of NK cell repertoire diversity, we used mass cytometry to simultaneously analyze 37 parameters, including 28 NK cell receptors, on peripheral blood NK cells from 5 sets of monozygotic twins and 12 unrelated donors of defined human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genotype. This analysis revealed a remarkable degree of NK cell diversity, with an estimated 6000 to 30,000 phenotypic populations within an individual and >100,000 phenotypes in the donor panel. Genetics largely determined inhibitory receptor expression, whereas activation receptor expression was heavily environmentally influenced. Therefore, NK cells may maintain self-tolerance through strictly regulated expression of inhibitory receptors while using adaptable expression patterns of activating and costimulatory receptors to respond to pathogens and tumors. These findings further suggest the possibility that discrete NK cell subpopulations could be harnessed for immunotherapeutic strategies in the settings of infection, reproduction, and transplantation."

We introduce an approach that identifies a disease phenotype from multiparameter single-cell measurements, which is based on the concept of ""supercell statistics"", a single-cell-based averaging procedure followed by a machine learning classification scheme. We are able to assess the optimal tradeoff between the number of single cells averaged and the number of measurements needed to capture phenotypic differences between healthy and diseased patients, as well as between different diseases that are difficult to diagnose otherwise. We apply our approach to two kinds of single-cell datasets, addressing the diagnosis of a premature aging disorder using images of cell nuclei, as well as the phenotypes of two non-infectious uveitides (the ocular manifestations of Behçet's disease and sarcoidosis) based on multicolor flow cytometry. In the former case, one nuclear shape measurement taken over a group of 30 cells is sufficient to classify samples as healthy or diseased, in agreement with usual laboratory practice. In the latter, our method is able to identify a minimal set of 5 markers that accurately predict Behçet's disease and sarcoidosis. This is the first time that a quantitative phenotypic distinction between these two diseases has been achieved. To obtain this clear phenotypic signature, about one hundred CD8(+) T cells need to be measured. Although the molecular markers identified have been reported to be important players in autoimmune disorders, this is the first report pointing out that CD8(+) T cells can be used to distinguish two systemic inflammatory diseases. Beyond these specific cases, the approach proposed here is applicable to datasets generated by other kinds of state-of-the-art and forthcoming single-cell technologies, such as multidimensional mass cytometry, single-cell gene expression, and single-cell full genome sequencing techniques."

The origins of the observed heterogeneity and its roles in the maintenance of pluripotency and the lineage specification of stem cells remain unclear. Addressing pertinent questions will require the employment of single-cell analysis methods as traditional cell biochemical and biomolecular assays yield mostly population-average data. In addition to time-lapse microscopy and flow cytometry, recent advances in single-cell genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic profiling are reviewed. The application of multiple displacement amplification, next generation sequencing, mass cytometry and spectrometry to stem cell systems is expected to provide a wealth of information affording unprecedented levels of multiparametric characterization of cell ensembles under defined conditions promoting pluripotency or commitment. Establishing connections between single-cell analysis information and the observed phenotypes will also require suitable mathematical models. Stem cell self-renewal and differentiation are orchestrated by the coordinated regulation of subcellular, intercellular and niche-wide processes spanning multiple time scales. Here, we discuss different modeling approaches and challenges arising from their application to stem cell populations. Integrating single-cell analysis with computational methods will fill gaps in our knowledge about the functions of heterogeneity in stem cell physiology.

This requirement is frequently compromized by process asynchrony phenomena or nonlinear process topologies. We discuss various computational deconvolution approaches to define molecular process coordinates and enable compilation of coherent data sets for cell state inference. In addition to the conceptual presentation of these approaches, we discuss the application of these methods to modeling of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Due to their generic applicability these computational approaches will contribute to the elucidation of dynamic intracellular signaling networks in various settings.

With the ability to simultaneously interrogate an unprecedented number of molecular components on a per cell basis, it offers the possibility to gain better understanding of single cell biology in heterogeneous samples. To upscale this single cell information to screening approaches by mass cytometry, a cell-based multiplexing technique, called mass-tag cellular barcoding (MCB), was developed. MCB enables the simultaneous analysis of multiple cell samples by using n metal ion tags to multiplex up to 2 (n) samples. Different mass tag combinations are used to label individual cell samples with a unique mass barcode that allows multiple samples to be combined and immunostained together for a single analysis on the mass cytometer. Taken together, MCB enables increased sample throughput, reduces antibody consumption, and increases the overall data quality. In this chapter, we describe the MCB to array the samples in a 96-well format that allows for medium-scale profiling/screening experiments to be run on a standard mass cytometer."

Yet, despite its importance for health, the ability to assess its quality of function has been poor, nor is much known on its variation between individuals. Hence direct assessment of immune health has largely been missing from medicine, and metrics of immune health are not well defined, especially in non-extreme states. This is chiefly due to the high complexity of the immune system. Recently emerging technologies now enable broad surveying of many immune system components at high resolution, setting forth a transformation of immunology and, through it, medicine. Such technologies enable, for the first time, high-resolution monitoring of an individual's immune system. The resulting information can be used for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, as well as to provide a quantitative, global view of the immune system, i.e. ""systems immunology."" This is especially relevant in the context of aging, in which the immune system exhibits profound alterations in state and function."

In contrast, transit through the CD4(+)CD8(+) stage involved a global shutdown of housekeeping genes that is rare among cells of the immune system and correlated tightly with expression of the transcription factor c-Myc. Selection driven by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules promoted a large-scale transcriptional reactivation. We identified distinct signatures that marked cells destined for positive selection versus apoptotic deletion. Differences in the expression of unexpectedly few genes accompanied commitment to the CD4(+) or CD8(+) lineage, a similarity that carried through to peripheral T cells and their activation, demonstrated by mass cytometry phosphoproteomics.

The protocol described here includes simultaneous measurements of beads and cells on the mass cytometer, subsequent extraction of the bead-based signature, and the application of an algorithm enabling correction of both short- and long-term signal fluctuations.

However, the issue of spectral overlap of fluorophore emissions has limited the number of simultaneous probes. In contrast, the new CyTOF mass cytometer by DVS Sciences couples a liquid single-cell introduction system to an ICP-MS. Rather than fluorophores, chelating polymers containing highly-enriched metal isotopes are coupled to antibodies or other specific probes. Because of the metal purity and mass resolution of the mass cytometer, there is no ""spectral overlap"" from neighboring isotopes, and therefore no need for compensation matrices. Additionally, due to the use of lanthanide metals, there is no biological background and therefore no equivalent of autofluorescence. With a mass window spanning atomic mass 103-203, theoretically up to 100 labels could be distinguished simultaneously. Currently, more than 35 channels are available using the chelating reagents available from DVS Sciences, allowing unprecedented dissection of the immunological profile of samples. Disadvantages to mass cytometry include the strict requirement for a separate metal isotope per probe (no equivalent of forward or side scatter), and the fact that it is a destructive technique (no possibility of sorting recovery). The current configuration of the mass cytometer also has a cell transmission rate of only ~25%, thus requiring a higher input number of cells. Optimal daily performance of the mass cytometer requires several steps. The basic goal of the optimization is to maximize the measured signal intensity of the desired metal isotopes (M) while minimizing the formation of oxides (M+16) that will decrease the M signal intensity and interfere with any desired signal at M+16. The first step is to warm up the machine so a hot, stable ICP plasma has been established. Second, the settings for current and make-up gas flow rate must be optimized on a daily basis. During sample collection, the maximum cell event rate is limited by detector efficiency and processing speed to 1000 cells/sec. However, depending on the sample quality, a slower cell event rate (300-500 cells/sec) is usually desirable to allow better resolution between cells events and thus maximize intact singlets over doublets and debris. Finally, adequate cleaning of the machine at the end of the day helps minimize background signal due to free metal."

However, current tools to design panels based on the biological characteristics of the target cell populations work exclusively based on technical parameters (e.g., instrument configurations, spectral overlap, and reagent availability). To address this shortcoming, we developed RchyOptimyx (cellular hieraRCHY OPTIMization), a computational tool that constructs cellular hierarchies by combining automated gating with dynamic programming and graph theory to provide the best gating strategies to identify a target population to a desired level of purity or correlation with a clinical outcome, using the simplest possible marker panels. RchyOptimyx can assess and graphically present the trade-offs between marker choice and population specificity in high-dimensional flow or mass cytometry datasets. We present three proof-of-concept use cases for RchyOptimyx that involve 1) designing a panel of surface markers for identification of rare populations that are primarily characterized using their intracellular signature; 2) simplifying the gating strategy for identification of a target cell population; 3) identification of a non-redundant marker set to identify a target cell population."

We aim to use NaLnF(4) nanoparticles for isotopic tags in mass cytometry. This application requires nanoparticles of narrow size distribution, diameters preferably less than 15 nm, and robust surface chemistry to avoid nonspecific interactions and to facilitate bioconjugation. Nanoparticles (NaHoF(4), NaEuF(4), NaGdF(4), and NaTbF(4)) were synthesized with diameters from 9 to 11 nm with oleic acid surface stabilization. The surface ligands were replaced by a series of mono-, di-, and tetraphosphonate PEG ligands, whose synthesis is reported here. The colloidal stability of the resulting particles was monitored over a range of pH values and in phosphate containing solutions. All of the PEG-phosphonate ligands were found to produce non-aggregated colloidally stable suspensions of the nanoparticles in water as judged by DLS and TEM measurements. However, in more aggressive solutions, at high pH and in phosphate buffers, the mono- and diphosphonate PEG ligands did not stabilize the particles and aggregation as well as flocculation was observed. However, the tetraphosphonate ligand was able to stabilize the particles at high pH and in phosphate buffers for extended periods of time."

The role of the polymer is to carry multiple copies of individual metal isotopes, typically as lanthanide ions, and to provide a reactive functionality for convenient attachment to a monoclonal antibody (mAb). For this application, the optimum combination of chain length, backbone structure, end group, pendant groups, and synthesis strategy has yet to be determined. Here we describe the synthesis of a new type of MCP based on anionic ring-opening polymerization of an activated cyclopropane (the diallyl ester of 1,1-cyclopropane dicarboxylic acid) using a combination of 2-furanmethanethiol and a phosphazene base as the initiator. This reaction takes place with rigorous control over molecular weight, yielding a polymer with a narrow molecular weight distribution, reactive pendant groups for introducing a metal chelator, and a functional end group with orthogonal reactivity for attaching the polymer to the mAbs. Following the ring-opening polymerization, a two-step transformation introduced diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) chelating groups on each pendant group. The polymers were characterized by NMR, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The binding properties toward Gd(3+) as a prototypical lanthanide (Ln) ion were also studied by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Attachment to a mAb involves a Diels-Alder reaction of the terminal furan with a bismaleimide, followed by a Michael addition of a thiol on the mAb, generated by mild reduction of a disulfide bond in the hinge region. Polymer samples with a number average degree of polymerization of 35, with a binding capacity of 49.5 ± 6 Ln(3+) ions per chain, were loaded with 10 different types of Ln ions and conjugated to 10 different mAbs. A suite of metal-tagged Abs was tested by mass cytometry in a 10-plex single cell analysis of human adult peripheral blood, allowing us to quantify the antibody binding capacity of 10 different cell surface antigens associated with specific cell types."

Recently, a comprehensive mass cytometry analysis was described for the hematopoietic differentiation program in human bone marrow from a healthy donor. The current study describes approaches to delineate cell cycle stages utilizing 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine (IdU) to mark cells in S phase, simultaneously with antibodies against cyclin B1, cyclin A, and phosphorylated histone H3 (S28) that characterize the other cell cycle phases. Protocols were developed in which an antibody against phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (Rb) at serines 807 and 811 was used to separate cells in G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle. This mass cytometry method yielded cell cycle distributions of both normal and cancer cell populations that were equivalent to those obtained by traditional fluorescence cytometry techniques. We applied this to map the cell cycle phases of cells spanning the hematopoietic hierarchy in healthy human bone marrow as a prelude to later studies with cancers and other disorders of this lineage."

Not only will such biomarkers yield insight into the development, remission, and exacerbation of a disease, they will undoubtedly improve diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy of classification, and ultimately guide treatment. This Review provides an introduction to these powerful technologies that could promote the identification of actionable biomarkers, including mass cytometry, protein arrays, and immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor high-throughput sequencing. In our opinion, these technologies should become part of routine clinical practice for the management of autoimmune diseases. The use of analytical tools to deconvolve the data obtained from use of these technologies is also presented here. These analyses are revealing a more comprehensive and interconnected view of the immune system than ever before and should have an important role in directing future treatment approaches for autoimmune diseases."

A recent technological advance in flow cytometry uses antibodies conjugated to elemental metal isotopes, rather than to fluorophores, to allow signal detection by atomic mass spectrometry. Unhampered by the limitations of overlapping emission fluorescence, mass cytometry increases the number of parameters that can be measured in single cells. However, mass cytometry is unable to take advantage of current fluorescent viability dyes. An alternative methodology was therefore developed here in which the platinum-containing chemotherapy drug cisplatin was used to resolve live and dead cells by mass cytometry. In a 1-min incubation step, cisplatin preferentially labeled nonviable cells from both adherent and suspension cultures, resulting in a platinum signal quantifiable by mass cytometry. This protocol was compatible with established sample processing steps for intracellular cytometry. Furthermore, the live/dead ratios were comparable between mass- and fluorescence-based cytometry. Importantly, although cisplatin is a known DNA-damaging agent, a 1-min ""pulse"" of cisplatin did not induce observable DNA damage or apoptotic responses even within 6-h post-exposure. Cisplatin can therefore be used as a viability reagent for a wide range of mass cytometry protocols."

In this study, we characterized commercially available cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and two lyophilized PBMC preparations, Cyto-Trol and PBMC-National Institute for Biological Standard and Control (NIBSC) relative to freshly prepared PBMC and whole blood samples. It was found that the ABC values for CD4 expression on cryopreserved PBMC were consistent with those of freshly obtained PBMC and whole blood samples. By comparison, the ABC value for CD4 expression on Cyto-Trol is lower and the value on PBMC-NIBSC is much lower than those of freshly prepared cell samples using both conventional flow cytometry and CyTOF™ mass cytometry. By performing simultaneous surface and intracellular staining measurements on these two cell samples, we found that both cell membranes are mostly intact. Moreover, CD4(+) cell diameters from both lyophilized cell preparations are smaller than those of PBMC and whole blood. This could result in steric interference in antibody binding to the lyophilized cells. Further investigation of the fixation effect on the detected CD4 expression suggests that the very low ABC value obtained for CD4(+) cells from lyophilized PBMC-NIBSC is largely due to paraformaldehyde fixation; this significantly decreases available antibody binding sites. This study provides confirmation that the results obtained from the newly developed mass cytometry are directly comparable to the results from conventional flow cytometry when both methods are standardized using the same ABC approach."

We discuss existing techniques for network inference. We review in detail our pipeline, which consists of an initial biclustering step, designed to estimate co-regulated groups; a network inference step, designed to select and parameterize likely regulatory models for the control of the co-regulated groups from the biclustering step; and a visualization and analysis step, designed to find and communicate key features of the network.

These polymer samples were loaded with three different types of lanthanide ions as well as palladium and platinum ions. The numbers of metal atoms per chain were determined by a combination of UV/vis and conventional ICP-MS measurements. The experiments with lanthanide ions demonstrated that a net anionic charge on the polymer is important for water solubility. These experiments also showed that at least one type of lanthanide ion (La(3+)) is capable of forming a bimetallic complex with pendant DTPA groups. Conditions were developed for loading these polymers with palladium and platinum ions. While these polymers could be conjugated to antibodies, the presence of Pd or Pt ions in the polymer interfered with the ability of the antibody to recognize its antigen. For example, a goat anti-mouse (secondary) antibody labeled with polymers that contain Pd or Pt no longer recognized a primary antibody in a sandwich assay. In mass cytometry assays, these Pd- or Pt-containing MCPs were very effective in recognizing dead cells and provide a new and robust assay for distinguishing live cells from dead cells."

Epub 2010 Oct 12.,Article has no keywords,"We describe the synthesis and characterization of metal-chelating polymers with a degree of polymerization of 67 and 79, high diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) functionality, M(w)/M(n) ≤ 1.17, and a maleimide as an orthogonal functional group for conjugation to antibodies. The polymeric disulfide form of the DP(n) = 79 DTPA polymer was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis to determine moisture and sodium-ion content and by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to determine the Gd(3+) binding capacity. These results showed each chain binds 68 ± 7 Gd(3+) per chain. Secondary goat antimouse IgG was covalently labeled with the maleimide form of the DTPA polymer (DP(n) = 79) carrying (159)Tb. Conventional ICPMS analysis of this conjugate showed each antibody carried an average of 161 ± 4 (159)Tb atoms. This result was combined with the ITC result to show there are an average of 2.4 ± 0.3 polymer chains attached to each antibody. Eleven monoclonal primary antibodies were labeled with different lanthanide isotopes using the same labeling methodology. Single cell analysis of whole umbilical cord blood stained with a mixture of 11 metal-tagged antibodies was performed by mass cytometry."

Epub 2010 Jul 21.,Article has no keywords,"This review paper describes a new technology, mass cytometry, that addresses applications typically run by flow cytometer analyzers, but extends the capability to highly multiparametric analysis. The detection technology is based on atomic mass spectrometry. It offers quantitation, specificity and dynamic range of mass spectrometry in a format that is familiar to flow cytometry practitioners. The mass cytometer does not require compensation, allowing the application of statistical techniques; this has been impossible given the constraints of fluorescence noise with traditional cytometry instruments. Instead of ""colors"" the mass cytometer ""reads"" the stable isotope tags attached to antibodies using metal-chelating labeling reagents. Because there are many available stable isotopes, and the mass spectrometer provides exquisite resolution between detection channels, many parameters can be measured as easily as one. For example, in a single tube the technique allows for the ready detection and characterization of the major cell subsets in blood or bone marrow. Here we describe mass cytometric immunophenotyping of human leukemia cell lines and leukemia patient samples, differential cell analysis of normal peripheral and umbilical cord blood; intracellular protein identification and metal-encoded bead arrays."

These metal-containing beads are also verified for their use as internal standards for this instrument. These beads were synthesized by multiple-stage dispersion polymerization with acrylic acid as a comonomer. Acrylic acid acts as a ligand to anchor the metal ions within the interior of the beads. Mass cytometry enabled the bead-by-bead measurement of the metal-content and determination of the metal-content distribution. Beads synthesized by dispersion polymerization that involved three stages were shown to have narrower bead-to-bead variation in their lanthanide content than beads synthesized by 2-stage dispersion polymerization. The beads exhibited insignificant release of their lanthanide content to aqueous solutions of different pHs over a period of six months. When mixed with KG1a or U937 cell lines, metal-containing polymer beads were shown not to affect the mass cytometry response to the metal content of element-tagged antibodies specifically attached to these cells."

The instrument is based on inductively coupled plasma time-of-flight mass spectrometry and comprises a three-aperture plasma-vacuum interface, a dc quadrupole turning optics for decoupling ions from neutral components, an rf quadrupole ion guide discriminating against low-mass dominant plasma ions, a point-to-parallel focusing dc quadrupole doublet, an orthogonal acceleration reflectron analyzer, a discrete dynode fast ion detector, and an 8-bit 1 GHz digitizer. A high spectrum generation frequency of 76.8 kHz provides capability for collecting multiple spectra from each particle-induced transient ion cloud, typically of 200-300 micros duration. It is shown that the transients can be resolved and characterized individually at a peak frequency of 1100 particles per second. Design considerations and optimization data are presented. The figures of merit of the instrument are measured under standard inductively coupled plasma (ICP) operating conditions (<3% cerium oxide ratio). At mass resolution (full width at half-maximum) M/DeltaM > 900 for m/z = 159, the sensitivity with a standard sample introduction system of >1.4 x 10(8) ion counts per second per mg L(-1) of Tb and an abundance sensitivity of (6 x 10(-4))-(1.4 x 10(-3)) (trailing and leading masses, respectively) are shown. The mass range (m/z = 125-215) and abundance sensitivity are sufficient for elemental immunoassay with up to 60 distinct available elemental tags. When <15 elemental tags are used, a higher sensitivity mode at lower resolution (M/DeltaM > 500) can be used, which provides >2.4 x 10(8) cps per mg L(-1) of Tb, at (1.5 x 10(-3))-(5.0 x 10(-3)) abundance sensitivity. The real-time simultaneous detection of multiple isotopes from individual 1.8 microm polystyrene beads labeled with lanthanides is shown. A real time single cell 20 antigen expression assay of model cell lines and leukemia patient samples immuno-labeled with lanthanide-tagged antibodies is presented."
